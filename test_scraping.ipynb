Also, this type of spending is up from 29% in 2022. Half of credit cardholders already have credit card debt, which is the highest percentage in 4.5 years, and that 6 in 10 credit card debtors have been in debt at least a year. Back-to-school costs, on average, for kids in kindergarten through 12th grade run about $875, according to The National Retail Federation. For the average college student, it\\'s about $1,365. [Fox Business]\\n\\nConsumers are running up their credit cards to cope with the high costs of everyday itemsgetty\\nConsumers Tap Credit Cards, Loans to Manage Inflation\\n\\nThe share of U.S. adults who were using credit cards or loans to make ends meet amid rising prices rose to nearly 40% in October 2023, up from roughly 37% a year prior, according to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Also, about a third (34%) of adults who lived in a household experiencing a job loss used a credit card or a loan to handle price increases. Gen Z and millennials were the age groups most likely to use loans and credit cards to respond to higher prices. Besides relying more on credit cards, the Boston Fed said consumers were taking other measures to cut costs. Per its report, consumers have reduced their spending by eating less restaurant food, canceling subscriptions, purchasing less fresh produce and meat and switching to generic products. Survey respondents also reported contributing less to their savings, working more, moving to less expensive housing and delaying significant purchases.

While the cost to merchants for processing cash-back transactions \"may be a few pennies,\" fees passed on to consumers are often far higher. Among the examples highlighted were Dollar General and Dollar Tree, which charge $1 or more when customers withdraw less than $50 in cash. People living in rural communities or those without nearby bank branches commonly turn to retailers to get cash. Nearly 19 million people in the US were \"underbanked\" in 2021, according to the FDIC. The CFPB said cash is more often used by low-income consumers, racial minorities and older people.

If the technology identifies any abnormalities during this verification process, it may use additional security checks via text message, email or phone call before completing the purchase. The goal of 3DS is to provide better transaction authentication to help everyone involved: customers, banks and online merchants. Users benefit from an improved experience with a simpler transaction.

      "p_text = '\\n\\n\\nIn early 2010, U.S. lawmakers gave what was supposed to be a gift to IRS agents with the grueling job of ensuring the wealthiest people and largest corporations pay their fair share of taxes. Tucked inside President Barack Obama\\'s landmark Affordable Care Act was a new law that prohibited shifting money around for the sole purpose of avoiding taxes. This struck at the heart of the complex offshore tax maneuvers — the shell companies, sham trusts and dubious intercompany loans — that the affluent use to help keep billions of dollars from government coffers. Suddenly the notion that many of these schemes were technically legal was cast in doubt. Now it was up to the IRS to enforce the new law.\\nIn an era of government cuts and starved social services, this new law — known as the economic substance doctrine — was supposed to help U.S. tax authorities fight the estimated $688 billion a year in unpaid taxes. But then nothing happened. The IRS hardly touched its new weapon against high-end tax evasion — leaving billions of dollars on the table and its agents with little experience in using the law. But why?\\nAn investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists shows how, after coming under pressure from the industries that help wealthy people and corporations avoid taxes, the IRS\\'s Large Business and International Division, or LB&I, issued a directive that blocked agents from using the economic substance doctrine.\\n\"The IRS had this institutional view not to raise it,\" Monte Jackel, a tax attorney who has served several stints as a high-ranking IRS lawyer, said of the economic substance doctrine. \"For a decade or so, it was a dead letter — invisible.\"\\nICIJ found that this IRS directive not only echoed some of the key requests of powerful tax industry players, it also copied several sentences directly from an industry lobbying letter that had urged restrictions on the new law, turning the exact words of tax attorneys for the wealthiest people into official IRS policy. Among those who prepared the lobbying letter were at least four tax attorneys at the corporate law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, where the IRS official who issued the directive had recently worked. That official, Heather Maloy, has since risen to top brass at the IRS, overseeing all of its enforcement divisions.\\nA congressional committee estimated that the new tax law was supposed to raise billions in revenue, meaning that the directive may have quietly cost the government large sums.\\nThe reporting adds to growing evidence that LB&I, the office tasked with policing the wealthiest taxpayers, often takes a deferential approach to these powerful players. It also sheds light on the prevalence in the leadership of the IRS and the Treasury Department of tax lawyers who have recently represented the sorts of wealthy taxpayers LB&I is supposed to regulate.\\nIn response to ICIJ\\'s questions, the IRS emphasized that a recent inspector general report found that the agency did not give large multinational corporations preferential treatment. It also defended its handling of the economic substance doctrine and said that it values input from outside the government. \"A cornerstone element of fair and balanced tax administration is allowing those affected by IRS policies to have an opportunity to offer input,\" the agency said in an emailed statement to ICIJ. \"The tax system cannot operate in a vacuum, and we have a responsibility to give taxpayers the opportunity to be heard as we implement policy.\"\\nICIJ recently revealed that LB&I applies different and friendlier rules when auditing the wealthy as opposed to small businesses, and that its upper management shies away from even considering egregious tax-dodging cases for criminal referrals. The tiny number of such referrals from LB&I — no more than 22 in a recent span of five years — has frustrated some officials within the IRS\\'s Criminal Investigation Division, who say they\\'re often unsupported in identifying cases involving the biggest taxpayers.\\nPresident Joe Biden\\'s administration vowed to tackle high-end tax evasion and secured a historic $80 billion from Congress in part to fulfill this pledge. Now, with this infusion of funding, LB&I is being put to the test. The agency recently made a dramatic reversal in how it regards the economic substance doctrine, touting it as a key tool to stand up to powerful tax cheats.\\nThe IRS now has to play catch-up with its deployment of the doctrine, after letting it gather dust since 2010. At stake are not only billions in government revenue, but also the fate of a key Biden campaign promise to stand up to some of the world\\'s wealthiest taxpayers.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommended reading\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Accountability\\n          \\n\\n            Inside the IRS unit taking on America\\'s millionaires and billionaires\\n          \\n Feb 21, 2024 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Accountability\\n          \\n\\n            New data shows IRS\\'s 10-year struggle to investigate tax crimes\\n          \\n Mar 19, 2024 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            INSIDE THE IRS\\n          \\n\\n            How investment firms shield the ultrawealthy from the IRS\\n          \\n Apr 03, 2024 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFearful of the new law\\nAt least for the richest Americans, avoiding huge amounts of tax often comes down to paying well-heeled accountants and tax attorneys to create complex arrangements that exploit legal loopholes. Corporate tax advisers, though, fear the economic substance doctrine because it can cut through the artificial complexity at the center of many of these schemes.\\nIn the decades leading up to 2010, the economic substance doctrine lived informally in the court system. The government used the doctrine based on case law — i.e., the opinions of previous judges — to cobble together ad hoc and sometimes inconsistent ways of asserting it in tax cases.\\nLawmakers saw formalizing the doctrine in federal legislation as a crucial step to strengthen it as a deterrent to high-end tax evasion. The issue united Democrats and Republicans in the belief that the growing tax shelter industry posed a threat to the country\\'s governance.\\nFor a decade, a group of U.S. senators tried repeatedly to make the doctrine official law and consequently faced fierce opposition from the industry representing private tax advisers. In 2003, then-Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said that legislating the doctrine would help fight the \"systemic corruption that plagues the accounting, legal and financial communities in the pursuit of tax shelters.\" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, a two-time chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, declared in 2007 that it was the \"right policy.\"\\nAlthough its enactment into law in 2010 was eclipsed in the news by the larger health-care reform bill, high-end tax advisers quickly took notice.\\nIn public pronouncements, the industry warned that the legislation had ushered in a new world where the codified economic substance doctrine could \"dramatically change the tax enforcement landscape.\" Just hours after the law passed, the corporate law giant Skadden, which has represented some of the country\\'s highest-profile tax evaders, warned that it \"will have an immediate effect on transactions in the planning stage\" and said \"taxpayers will need to proceed cautiously.\"\\nThe Big Four accounting firms — known to design highly complex structures of offshore shell companies for clients seeking to avoid taxes — also recoiled.\\n\\n\\nPwC sought to shield itself from the potential impact of the economic substance doctrine.  Image: Michael Kappeler/picture alliance via Getty Images  \\n\\nTax advisers should have difficult conversations with clients and take \"a back-to-basics, prudent course,\" warned an article in an industry publication co-authored by two tax accountants at accounting giant PwC.\\nThe Big Four firms began trying to shield themselves from the law\\'s impact, according to documents leaked to ICIJ as part of the Paradise and Pandora Papers. In an agreement to provide tax services to a hedge fund using an entity in the British Virgin Islands, PwC stated it would not be liable for \"penalties imposed on you if any portion of a transaction is determined to lack economic substance,\" citing the 2010 law. In another tax services contract for a major private equity firm using shell companies in the Cayman Islands, Deloitte said it assumed no \"responsibility for any penalties resulting from client\\'s failure to meet the requirements of the economic substance doctrine.\"\\nDeloitte and PwC did not comment for this story.\\nThe law appeared to be changing the behavior of some of the largest firms. But would this last?\\nLike Santa Claus\\nBack in the U.S., the powerful tax law firms that work closely with the Big Four pressed the IRS to restrain its new powers. On Jan. 18, 2011, a group of eminent corporate tax lawyers sent a 66-page letter to then-LB&I Commissioner Maloy and other IRS executives. It urged the IRS to place extensive restrictions on the law that would, in practice, widely obstruct agents\\' ability to use it. The letter called the law\\'s civil fines \"a significant stick\" and urged the IRS \"to be measured in how it swings this stick.\"\\nThis letter was written and reviewed by various prominent lawyers, including at least four tax attorneys at Skadden, the firm where Maloy had recently worked as a tax attorney. Two of those were partners at Skadden.\\nIt didn\\'t take long for the private sector to get what it wanted from LB&I.\\nOn July 15, 2011, Maloy issued a directive that required agents take a series of steps and analyze more than two dozen factors before even asking for approval from a high-ranking IRS executive to use the new law. Agents had to notify the taxpayer as soon as they even considered asking for approval to pursue the economic substance doctrine, and then an IRS executive had to offer the taxpayer a chance to explain their position before the agent could receive approval to use the doctrine. The directive narrowed the scope of penalties agents could seek and defined how agents were generally supposed to analyze transactions — provisions sought by industry.\\nBy placing procedural hurdles in the way of using the doctrine, the directive effectively torpedoed a tax law that legislators had fought for a decade to pass. In addition to fulfilling key requests of industry players, the directive copied three sentences directly from the 66-page lobbying letter into official government policy.\\n\\nHigh-end tax attorneys celebrated the directive. A news bulletin on one tax law firm\\'s website trumpeted: \"LB&I directive softens economic substance doctrine.\" Another firm declared that the steps imposed on agents will likely place \"a damper on the number\" of cases in which the doctrine could be used.\\nIndustry players themselves \"could not have written a more favorable set of audit guidelines than those in the new LB&I Directive,\" observed Jasper Cummings, a tax attorney with the law firm Alston & Bird LLP who co-authored the 66-page lobbying letter, in a memo posted to the firm\\'s website.\\n\"As a result of the Directive recently issued,\" Cummings added, \"the Economic Substance Doctrine will begin to share a key attribute of Santa Claus: to be more talked about than seen.\"\\nIn a memo posted to its website, Skadden described the directive as fulfilling hopes of the industry and said it provided a \"welcome assurance\" that the new law \"will not be asserted without considered review.\"\\nCounsel said the approval process was too burdensome, so they didn\\'t want to pursue it … They made it administratively impossible to use.\\nOne industry contributor to the 66-page lobbying letter said in a 2018 academic article that as a result of the Maloy directive, the \"economic substance doctrine arguably loses any deterrent effect … because taxpayers know that the IRS is unlikely to raise the economic substance issue.\"\\nAn LB&I agent who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the press said he worked on an audit several years ago in which a wealthy individual had dodged millions in taxes through a series of maneuvers that the agent believed could be challenged under the economic substance doctrine. But, the agent said, the July 2011 directive stopped him from using it, partly because of hesitance from the IRS attorneys he worked with.\\n\"Counsel said the approval process was too burdensome, so they didn\\'t want to pursue it,\" the agent told ICIJ.\\nAfter this instance, the agent said that he did not try to use the doctrine again: \"They made it administratively impossible to use.\"\\n\\n\\nThe U.S. Treasury building in Washington, D.C., U.S.  Image: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images  \\n\\n\\'A revolving-door influence\\'\\nFor years, watchdogs and lawmakers have expressed concern about the potentially corrupting effects of individuals from the private tax industry ending up in high ranks of the IRS and its parent agency, the Treasury Department. Prominent tax attorneys from Big Four accounting firms or corporate law firms sometimes help implement favorable policies for their former clients. These officials often rejoin the private firms with rapid promotions.\\nEarlier this year, ICIJ reporting showed that top executives in LB&I commonly switch hats from regulating the wealthiest taxpayers to working for them. A review of LB&I executive lists from the past 13 years shows that out of 114 top executives named, at least a quarter either had worked for a major accounting firm, a tax consulting firm or a major tax law firm shortly before joining the IRS, or left the IRS for such private sector roles.\\nThe IRS\\'s watchdog, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), warned last year that the movement of employees between the IRS and accounting firms and big companies raised \"impartiality concerns.\"\\nAs the IRS embarks on a major hiring spree with its new billions, the questions around guarding against industry influence have gained new urgency.\\n\"People from the private sector provide important viewpoints and unique expertise needed to help the IRS run the tax system,\" IRS spokesperson Robyn Walker told ICIJ in a statement for a previous story. \"This takes on even more importance as the agency works to build compliance work in high-risk corporate and high-wealth areas.\"\\nThe agency also told ICIJ that safeguards are in place to prevent conflicts of interest. These rules forbid officials from working on matters too closely related to their work for a former employer in the private sector. Yet these safeguards generally rely on these officials to proactively identify and declare such conflicts to the agency.\\nIn January 2022, TIGTA received an eight-page complaint from an agent alleging that Maloy\\'s directive had been influenced by the private sector. The complaint alleged that \"we at the IRS are not enforcing our tax laws on multinational taxpayers using tax structures lacking economic substance.\"\\nThe complaint emphasized that the 66-page letter urging LB&I to restrict the new law was co-authored by attorneys at Skadden, Maloy\\'s former employer, and alleged that the government was not enforcing its own rules around conflicts of interest.\\n\"There\\'s clearly a revolving door influence in play within the IRS,\" the complaint stated.\\n\"Private sector attorneys from numerous firms known to be involved in promoting, opining, and defending abusive tax structures seized the opportunity to use revolving door colleagues in the executive ranks of the IRS to request, influence and craft guidance,\" the complaint also said. The complaint urged the inspector general to assist the IRS in reviewing and revoking the directive.\\n\\n\\n\\nLeak to us\\n\\n\\nContact ICIJ\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDo you have a story about corruption, fraud, or abuse of power?\\nICIJ accepts information about wrongdoing by corporate, government or public services around the world. We do our utmost to guarantee the confidentiality of our sources. \\nLEAK TO ICIJ\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the world\\'s largest corporate law firms, Skadden has a tax practice that employs a former IRS commissioner and a former executive of LB&I. One of the authors of the 66-page letter, Brendan O\\'Dell, left Skadden in 2016 to spend six years in high-ranking positions within LB&I and Treasury before becoming the director of tax controversy for Amazon. Another of the letter\\'s authors, Cary Douglas Pugh, left Skadden in 2014 to become a judge in federal tax court in Washington, D.C., making her among the most powerful people in tax law.\\nThe IRS agent\\'s complaint to TIGTA has not been previously reported. Michael Welu, a former IRS agent who has been outspoken on the issues he saw within LB&I during his more than three decades at the IRS, provided a copy of the complaint to ICIJ. The complaint\\'s author, Brian Visalli, is a special agent in the Criminal Investigation Division.\\n\"While I\\'ll confirm I\\'m a government whistleblower, I will not confirm or deny any specific complaints or documents I\\'ve provided to TIGTA,\" Visalli told ICIJ in a LinkedIn message. Visalli added that, due to concerns over retaliation, he would not comment further.\\nIn 2015, after almost six years of running LB&I, Maloy left the IRS to become the US Tax Controversy Leader at the Big Four accounting firm EY. EY\\'s website from that time lists Maloy as a contact in relation to its services around a highly technical practice known as \"transfer pricing\" that is at the heart of some of the largest tax avoidance schemes.\\nAfter five years at EY, Maloy returned to the IRS as a top executive in charge of the entire agency\\'s compliance efforts. The heads of LB&I, Criminal Investigation and other major compliance divisions now report to her.\\nICIJ found that Maloy was not the only government official receiving policy requests from former private-sector colleagues related to the 2010 law. In January 2011, Lisa Zarlenga, then a tax partner at Steptoe & Johnson LLP — a corporate law firm that had opposed to the new law — was named as an author on the 66-page letter requesting restrictions on the IRS\\'s use of the doctrine. Two of Zarlenga\\'s colleagues at Steptoe, Mark Silverman and Amanda Varma, were also co-authors of the letter.\\nBut a similar letter co-authored by Silverman and Varma and sent just 3½ months later listed Zarlenga as a recipient. This was because Zarlenga had switched hats to become a high-ranking tax policy official at Treasury.\\nIn an interview with ICIJ, Zarlenga said she had nothing to do with Maloy\\'s directive. \"Treasury would have had no involvement in that directive. I saw it when it was published in Tax Notes along with everyone else.\"\\nIn an interview after the the 2011 directive, Silverman — who had helped lead Steptoe\\'s opposition to the doctrine — called the directive \\'thoughtful\\' and \"extremely well done.\"\\nZarlenga, who now heads Steptoe\\'s Tax Policy Practice, said that it\\'s both common and important for the industry to weigh in on what the IRS is working on. \"Government officials interact pretty regularly with practitioners,\" she said. \"It\\'s all part of the flow of information. Otherwise, the government attorneys are sort of sitting in an ivory tower and they don\\'t know what is going on.\"\\nNew life for an old law\\nSeveral months after TIGTA received the complaint in 2022, the IRS quietly rolled back the LB&I directive at issue, replacing it with a set of rules that stripped away a number of restrictions on agents\\' use of the economic substance doctrine. This was more than a decade after Congress passed the doctrine into law.\\nThe IRS did not respond to requests to comment on this story or answer questions about why it changed its rules around the doctrine in 2022.\\n\\nSuddenly the industry that had once applauded the directive sounded the alarm once more. In the wake of the new guidance, EY told its clients that \"taxpayers should focus on penalty protection\" and should consult tax professionals \"before entering into transactions with related parties\" — a technical term that generally means shifting assets or liabilities between entities all owned by a single person or business.\\nIn a post on its website, corporate law giant Baker McKenzie said the updated directive exemplifies what it called \"the IRS\\'s increasingly offensive posture.\"\\nThe law firm was right. In August 2022, Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which included the $80 billion for the IRS to help fulfill his promise to make the wealthiest people and corporations pay their fair share of taxes.\\nDespite its languid existence after being passed, the 2010 law has become a critical part of this effort. In June, the IRS announced an initiative to tackle tax abuse in the highly complex realm of investment partnerships, which have become a key means for the richest people on Earth to increase their wealth while minimizing the U.S. government\\'s slice of the pie. In announcing the move, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen raised eyebrows by stating that \"many of these transactions violate the codified economic substance doctrine\" — a clear shot at the tax planners serving the ultrawealthy.\\n\\n\\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.  Image: Justin Tallis - WPA Pool/Getty Images  \\n\\nFollowing through on this tougher rhetoric may be difficult, though. Recent ICIJ reporting showed that LB&I often takes an accommodating approach toward the largest taxpayers. Over the past five years, the division flagged no more than 22 instances of possible tax crimes for criminal investigators to review further — out of trillions of dollars in annual income from large corporations and ultrawealthy people that the office oversees. The IRS office that covers small businesses and self-employed people flagged roughly 40 times more possible crimes.\\nIn the agency\\'s own comments to ICIJ for earlier stories, the IRS suggested that large corporations break the law less often than other types of businesses, saying their checks and balances and their use of independent accountants \"generally limit the opportunity for criminal activity.\" ICIJ found that the agency treats these powerful taxpayers accordingly.\\nOn Wednesday, TIGTA released an extensive report on the IRS\\'s challenges to stand up to tax evasion by multinational corporations and addressed frustrations of agents around the difficulty of using the economic substance doctrine. The report also said that the IRS\\'s 2022 change to the directive was \"a result of gaining experience and a level of comfort in the application of the doctrine.\" It added that \"the IRS could not provide us with the number of cases where examination teams considered the Economic Substance Doctrine.\"\\nThe report, which was premised on determining whether the IRS gives multinational corporations preferential treatment, said it found no instances of such treatment. It did, however, recommend that LB&I review its procedures around enforcement of multinational taxpayers, including around its use of the economic substance doctrine.\\nExperts say that the decade when the doctrine lay dormant may put the office at a disadvantage for a number of reasons. One is that the IRS\\'s agents and attorneys have little experience using it and could be forced into a trial-and-error approach. Some commentators say that, despite all of the commotion around the law, it may be vulnerable to legal challenges. The previous dearth of cases involving the new law also means that judges are just now getting the chance to issue significant rulings on it. The way judges interpret any tax law sends important signals to the IRS about how to pursue winning legal arguments in court — where they face tax attorneys for large corporations and the ultrawealthy known to spend massively to defeat the IRS.\\n\"They haven\\'t had a lot of experience in actually applying it in real-world cases or seriously thinking about it,\" Jackel, the tax attorney, said of the 2010 law. \"It will be a slow process for them to get up to speed on it and be confident in their ability to assert the doctrine.\"\\n\\n\\nGIVE TO HELP US INVESTIGATE!\\n\\nHelp us fight corruption, injustice and inequality with just $25/month.\\n\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEngineering a $2.4 billion deduction\\nSome of the IRS\\'s cases using the 2010 law are beginning to make their way through the courts. Most significant of these is the agency\\'s attempt to invalidate a $2.4 billion tax deduction claimed by Liberty Global, the multinational telecommunications firm led by billionaire John C. Malone. With a net worth of roughly $9.8 billion, Malone is the largest voting shareholder in Liberty Global and is listed by Bloomberg as the second largest private landowner in the U.S., holding some 2 million acres across the country.\\nIn 2020, Liberty Global asked the IRS for a $110 million refund for overpaying its 2018 taxes. The massive refund request was based on a complex series of maneuvers — involving shuffling assets between subsidiaries in places like Belgium, the Netherlands and Slovakia — that had been created by Liberty Global\\'s tax department with help from Deloitte. In challenging the refund request, Justice Department lawyers alleged that the entire point of the transactions was to improperly exploit a new loophole in federal tax law.\\n\\n\\nBillionaire John C. Malone is the largest shareholder in Liberty Global. In 2020, Liberty Global asked the IRS for a $110 million refund for overpaying its 2018 taxes.  Image: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images  \\n\\nLiberty Global\\'s tactics did not emerge out of thin air. In one filing, the Justice Department noted that the \"situation arises because tax litigators have been developing strategies\" like Liberty Global\\'s. In emails contained in court records, Liberty Global\\'s tax department discussed paying Deloitte and another Big Four firm, KPMG, hundreds of thousands of dollars for their work on the complex international tax structures. The Justice Department attorneys noted that Skadden had publicly endorsed a refund tactic similar to that of Liberty Global.\\nSkadden did not respond to a request for comment.\\nIn October 2023, the IRS won its case against Liberty Global, with a federal judge in Colorado ruling that the company\\'s use of a loophole was not permitted under the 2010 law.\\nThat ruling was \"the worst nightmare for tax planners who rely on \\'catching\\' Congress in a glitch in the law,\" wrote Jasper Cummings, the tax attorney at Alston & Bird. \"This Liberty Global opinion is by far the scariest [economic substance doctrine] opinion of recent times and shows a Justice Department unleashed from the historic norms of the income tax.\"\\nLiberty Global maintains that its tax reporting in connection with the case was correct. Although Liberty Global had acknowledged that the maneuvers did not have any true business purpose apart from avoiding taxes, according to court documents, it appealed the ruling in April on technical grounds around applying the doctrine. The firm\\'s lawyers said \"the court fundamentally misunderstood\" the case and asserted that the IRS \"wrongly wields the economic substance doctrine to rewrite, rather than interpret, the law.\"\\nIf Liberty Global prevails in its appeal, it could create a precedent, perhaps as high as with the U.S. Supreme Court, that would weaken the IRS\\'s use of the doctrine moving forward.\\nThe law firm representing Liberty Global in this quest: Skadden.\\nDelphine Reuter and Rick Sia contributed to reporting\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Topics: Accountability, Auditors, Inequality, IRS, Tax, United States\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Contact reporter \\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n        Our team\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpencer Woodman\\nReporter\\nContact\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to know when we publish?\\n\\n\\nHelp us change the world.

      "p_text = '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrice Gouging is Definitely Real, and We Should Definitely Do Something About It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Harris campaign has been criticized for proposing price controls on groceries, but that\\'s actually not a bad idea at all. \\n\\n\\n\\nStephen Prager\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfiled 27 August 2024\\n                 in\\nEconomics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a campaign speech earlier this month, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris laid out several new planks of her economic agenda. Among them were expansions to the child tax credit, subsidies for homebuyers, and caps on prescription drug costs. But the policy that seems to have the most people talking is Harris\\'s proposal for the \"first-ever federal ban\" on price gouging for food and groceries.\\n\\n According to Forbes, grocery prices have increased 27 percent since July 2019. And while inflation has cooled back to roughly pre-pandemic levels, American families are still feeling the pinch, spending the greatest percentage of their household budgets on food in three decades, according to the Department of Agriculture. If you shop for groceries, you\\'ve surely seen it: A carton of grade-A eggs that cost $1.40 five years ago now costs more than $3 on average. A gallon of milk that cost just under $3 now costs nearly $4. And a pound of beef that cost less than $4 now costs around $5.50.\\n Polls show that inflation is still the number-one issue voters are worried about, and Harris is attempting to address that concern. While the major spikes in inflation that took place over the first two years of the Biden administration were multifaceted, with supply-chain hiccups, the war in Ukraine, and increased demand from a strong labor market all playing a role, Harris is making the case that price gouging by large corporations was also to blame. \"Many big grocery chains that have seen production costs level off have nevertheless kept prices high,\" says a fact sheet from her campaign. To deal with this problem, Harris says she plans to \"set clear rules of the road to make clear that big corporations can\\'t unfairly exploit consumers to run up excessive profits on food and groceries\" and \"secure new authority for the [Federal Trade Commission] and state attorneys general to investigate and impose strict new penalties on companies that break the rules.\"\\xa0\\n Harris\\'s rollout of this policy has been widely panned in the press. The libertarian magazine Reason called it \"dishonest and stupid,\" which is unsurprising coming from them, but even more mainstream publications haven\\'t been much kinder, with the Atlantic\\'s Josh Barro calling Harris\\'s plan \"economically dumb\" and saying her \"promises make no sense to people acquainted with supply and demand.\" Positive write-ups, like Nick Hanauer\\'s in the New Republic, have been the exception rather than the rule. The skepticism is not entirely unwarranted. For the moment, Harris\\'s policy is frustratingly vague. Nowhere has she defined the term \"price-gouging,\" nor has she given any parameters for what constitutes \"excessive profits,\" which makes it hard to give her particular ideas for tackling the problem a critical evaluation. Additionally, 37 U.S. states already have some form of price gouging law on the books. Harris needs to clarify what exactly her proposal would do that these laws have failed to do.\\xa0\\n But a lot of commentators have taken issue not with the policy\\'s lack of detail, but with its very premise. As you\\'d expect, conservatives including Donald Trump are running with the line that proposing price controls proves Harris is a \"communist.\" (A line that only makes sense, Newsweek points out, if you are also willing to call Richard Nixon a communist.) Allison Schrager of the right-wing Manhattan Institute has stated that Harris was reviving the \"price-gouging myth\" and that her policy was \"the wrong solution to a nonexistent problem.\"\\nEven liberal publications have taken a similarly derisive tone. In an August 15 editorial, the Washington Post\\'s Catherine Rampell suggested that conservatives had a point when calling Harris\\'s plan \"communist,\" and said that the Vice President was \"exploiting [inflation] for demagogic gain because push-polling suggests people are mad about \\'greed.\\'\" In USA Today, Nicole Russell wrote that \"No one with a half-way functioning brain thinks that inflation, which caused high prices, at the local grocer is due to price gouging by corporations.\" CNN\\'s news article on the policy, which carries the rather opinionated headline that \"Harris\\' plan to stop price gouging could create more problems than it solves\" is a touch more charitable, saying that \"many economists contend corporate profits were juiced by that thing you learned in Econ 101: supply and demand—not corporate greed (alone, anyway).\"\\nIt would be one thing if these articles simply argued that Harris\\'s proposed method to combat price gouging was faulty or ill-considered. I don\\'t think the contours of the policy are clear enough yet to make that judgment, but these writers are certainly free to give their predictions. But the writers don\\'t just argue that Harris is wrong about how to fight price gouging. They seem to think that the mere idea of price gouging is laughable, something that nobody with even a basic degree of economic literacy could believe is a real problem.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nExcept that\\'s obviously not true. We know that companies have dramatically increased their profits on the backs of consumers in the last few years. Pointing to an increase in corporate profits from 9.7 percent of America\\'s total GDP in 2020 to 11.2 percent in 2023, Hanauer estimates that companies \"have gouged their way to an almost unbelievable $1.5 trillion in excess profits since 2020—that\\'s in addition to their pre-pandemic profit rates.\" This means that price gouging has cost American families $12,000 on average in that time frame.\\nFood manufacturers have attempted to justify increasing prices by pointing to the increased costs of labor and materials, as well as supply chain hiccups that created shortages. If companies were only raising their prices to accommodate rising input costs, this would make sense. But grocery stores and manufacturers have both been bringing in considerably bigger profits than they did before the pandemic.\\xa0\\nSome of the price increases have come from profits at the retail level. According to a report from the Federal Trade Commission, food and beverage retailers increased their revenues from 5.6 percent above their total cost in 2015 to more than 6 percent in 2021 and 7 percent in 2023. And according to Forbes, \"The top 10 retailers increased their combined profits by over $10 billion [in 2021 and 2022] and issued over $15 billion in shareholder buybacks.\" And on Tuesday, a Kroger pricing executive, Andy Groff,\\xa0even admitted during questioning at an FTC hearing that the company\\'s objective was to \"pass through our inflation to consumers\" and that \"on milk and eggs, retail inflation has been significantly higher than cost inflation.\"\\nMeanwhile, a lot of gouging happened at the manufacturer level too. Reporting from April 2023 by Nik Popli, in Time magazine, provides several examples of major companies that saw historic windfalls in the pandemic\\'s aftermath:\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nAt Kraft-Heinz, the multinational food company that makes Oscar Mayer, Jell-O, and Kool Aid, profits for the quarter ending at the end of 2022 were up nearly 450%, compared to the prior year, at $887 million. Tyson Foods, the largest meat company in the U.S., more than doubled its profits between the first quarters of 2021 and 2022. And General Mills, which owns Kix, Trix, and Chex among other recognizable cereal labels, saw its fourth quarter profits last year rise 97% compared to the previous quarter.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nEven four years after the initial shock of the pandemic, many companies that raised their prices have not brought them back down. For example, even as input costs dropped in 2023, PepsiCo announced that they would not bring their prices back down to accommodate it. In fact, they did the opposite, increasing prices by double digits in 2023 and 2024. The Groundwork Collaborative, a group of progressive economists, has found this to be true across the economy as a whole. \"Corporate profit margins,\" they wrote in a study published in January, \"have remained high and even grown—as labor costs have stabilized, nonlabor input costs have come down, and supply chain snarls have eased.\" Looking at inflation from April to September 2023, they found that corporate profits accounted for 53 percent of the increase in consumer prices, compared with just 11 percent forty years before the pandemic.\\xa0\\nAnother study, from the U.K.-based think tanks Common Wealth and the Institute for Public Policy Research, looked at the financial statements of companies from the U.S., U.K., European Union, Brazil, and South Africa. It determined that across the period from 2019 to 2022, the U.S. experienced 9 percent inflation while the Eurozone experienced 11 percent. But at the same time, corporate profits increased by anywhere from 32 to 44 percent depending on the country. Fortune magazine described this pattern as evidence that companies were \"lying to you about inflation.\"\\nIt\\'s not just lefty think tanks reaching these conclusions. The International Monetary Fund (not exactly a cabal of hardened communists) looked at inflation across the Eurozone in 2022 and found that 45 percent of it could be attributed to \"domestic profits.\" The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City reached a similar conclusion about inflation in the U.S., stating that \"markup growth,\" that is, the increase in the ratio of how much a firm charges vs. production costs, \"was a major contributor to inflation in 2021.\" This and other economic analyses demonstrating such astonishing profiteering even surprised some in the belly of the beast. Albert Edwards, a strategist at one of Europe\\'s oldest investment banks, Société Générale, said the following in April 2023:\\n\\xa0\\n\\nAfter working in finance for over 40 years I had felt there wasn\\'t much that could surprise me. Yet I find the unprecedented levels of corporate Greedflation in this economic cycle astonishing. The latest release of US whole economy profits data delivered another shock to my weakening confidence that the capitalist system is working as it should.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother criticism of Harris\\'s crusade against \"price gouging\" is the idea that grocery prices are no longer a problem because the rate of inflation has settled back to normal levels. While this is true that inflation has cooled, it\\'s not actually helpful in terms of high food prices. Inflation is the rate of increase, so when grocery costs rise dramatically for years and then stop, it might technically be true that \"inflation has gone down\"—but we\\'re still stuck with the price increases from the past years, and Americans are still paying a greater percentage of their incomes for groceries than they were five years ago. And this doesn\\'t even begin to address the fact that the costs of other major expenses like housing, energy, medical care, and transportation have also grown considerably. An Urban Institute study from 2023 found that in order to pay for groceries, families were increasingly going into credit card debt, relying on apps like Buy Now, Pay Later, or even taking out predatory payday loans.\\n To be clear, groceries are just one of many areas where the government should intervene to make life more affordable, and addressing price gouging on food should not come at the expense of addressing it in other areas of life. (To her credit, Harris has proposed policies of varying quality and specificity to address childcare, housing, and prescription drug costs too. In Jacobin, Matt Bruenig has a useful article breaking each of them down.)\\n It\\'s clear, however, that food manufacturers and retailers got away with screwing us badly over the past few years. The New York Times reported earlier this year that a lot of companies have been \"testing the limits\" of how much they could charge consumers, and found there were fewer than they once thought:\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nBig companies that had previously pushed through one standard price increase per year are now raising prices more frequently. Retailers increasingly use digital price displays, which they can change with the touch of a button. Across the economy, executives trying to maximize profits are effectively running tests to see what prices consumers will bear before they stop buying.\\n \\nHuge disruptions to supply chains pushed up corporate costs during the pandemic and forced many companies to think more creatively about their pricing strategies, [Alexander MacKay, coleads the Pricing Lab at Harvard Business] said. That supercharged a trend toward more rigorous pricing, and showed many companies that they could more boldly play with prices without chasing shoppers away. The experimentation continues even as costs ease.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nStores like Walmart and Kroger, meanwhile, are increasingly exploring the possibilities of so-called \"dynamic pricing,\" a practice similar to the \"surge pricing\" that makes Uber and Lyft rides cost more at peak hours. As a letter from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bob Casey warns, digital price labels may soon be used to \"rais[e] prices suddenly and at times when certain products are in highest demand,\" such as \"the price of turkeys in the days leading up to Thanksgiving, or the price of ice cream on a hot day.\"\\n Inflation may have come back to normal—more or less—but it\\'s only a matter of time before the next economic crisis comes around. We need to have guardrails in place to make sure that companies can\\'t take advantage. So what can be done?\\n\\n\\n\\n After getting flogged in the press, the Harris campaign has attempted to reject any notion that they are proposing sweeping, industry-wide \"price controls.\" The campaign has suggested, in characteristically vague terms, that Harris\\'s policy would more closely mirror already existing state laws that prevent jacking up the prices of certain goods in cases of emergency—\"the sort of laws that prevent stores from quadrupling the price of snow shovels right after a blizzard hits,\" as the New York Times says.\\n It\\'s hard to know whether Harris and her team are backtracking, or if the campaign left the policy intentionally vague to test the response. But regardless, it\\'s a shame to see them so responsive to media backlash and obvious bad-faith attacks from Republicans, who will call them communists no matter what they propose.\\xa0\\nIt\\'s also a shame that Democrats are so quick to summarily dismiss the idea of broader price controls. This is a needless concession to the orthodoxy of \"Economics 101,\" which is usually more conventional wisdom than actual fact. Indeed, many of the arguments I have seen thrashing Harris at the mere suggestion that she may impose \"price controls\" rely heavily on their theoretical shortcomings in a utopian market dreamscape rather than how they\\'ve actually played out in reality. Let\\'s take Rampell\\'s argument in the Washington Post. She suggests that Harris would likely model a piece of price gouging legislation off a bill introduced by Elizabeth Warren in 2020 (a fair assumption at the time, since Harris had not yet backed off the idea of wide-reaching price controls). Rampell writes:\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nIt\\'s hard to exaggerate how bad this policy is. It is, in all but name, a sweeping set of government-enforced price controls across every industry, not only food. Supply and demand would no longer determine prices or profit levels. Far-off Washington bureaucrats would. The FTC would be able to tell, say, a Kroger in Ohio the acceptable price it can charge for milk.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nThere are a few obvious red flags here. For one thing, there\\'s the simplistic dichotomy of good, natural, virtuous \"supply and demand\" being subverted by the big, scary \"far-off Washington bureaucrats\" who seek to \"control prices.\" Really, all prices are the result of choices from someone. The only question is who. A Kroger pricing manager\\'s only incentive is to maximize the company\\'s profits by charging as much as they believe they can get away with. At least a \"far-off Washington bureaucrat\" would face some mechanism of democratic accountability. \\nRampell also brings up the dangers of shortages, which is another common argument against price controls. The theory goes that by limiting the price a producer can charge, you limit their incentive to produce. We\\'ve seen instances of this before: Rampell links to a story from Argentina in 2007, where retailers could not find cattle farmers who were willing to sell beef to them at government prices. If you go back further, to World War II, you can find stories of meat producers packing sausages with \"soybeans, potatoes, or cracker meal\" and selling muskrat steaks to save money due to the government suppression of meat prices.  \\n For the era of greedflation, a possible alternative solution to capping prices would be to instead cap profits. As historian Uwe Fuhrmann writes, this is something that West Germany did to curb inflation after World War II: \"the authorities established legally binding \\'maximum prices for end consumers\\' and capped profit margins at 20 percent. Only after this combination of price controls and revenue caps did prices finally go down…\" \\n But there are also plenty of modern examples of price controls being used successfully in the United States. Rent controls are some of the best examples, as catalogued by Mark Paul last year in the American Prospect:\\n\\xa0\\n\\nOne study of rent control in New Jersey—a state with a rich history of embracing rent control—found that, over three decades, rent control increased housing supply (though this was largely attributed to landlords slicing up larger units into smaller ones). Other studies have repeatedly confirmed that rent control doesn\\'t affect the overall supply of housing, though landlords may take advantage of poorly written rent control laws that allow them to convert existing rentals into condos to better capture price increases and skirt the intentions of rent control laws—loopholes that could easily be shut […]\\n\\xa0\\nThere are further benefits that the conventional wisdom misses. One, rent control works; as study after study has shown, rent regulation keeps housing more affordable. In Massachusetts, researchers have found that tenants in controlled units pay just half as much in rent as those in non-controlled units of similar size and quality. On the opposite coast, L.A. renters in regulated units pay one-quarter to one-third less in rent than those in nonregulated units—meaning hundreds of dollars a month in savings for households often living paycheck to paycheck.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nYou\\'ve also probably heard that Medicare recently \"negotiated\" the price of expensive prescription drugs. This is effectively an example of the government using its outsized influence as a buyer of these drugs to control prices. Separately, as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration also imposed more direct \"inflation penalties\"—price controls, in other words—on 64 drugs whose prices increased faster than the rate of inflation. And it introduced a $35/month cap on insulin for Medicare patients, which has been so popular that Donald Trump is trying to take credit for it.\\nSo when it comes to capping the price of groceries, we shouldn\\'t be so quick to dismiss price controls out of hand. But that doesn\\'t mean they are the only solution to inflation either.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nBreaking up food monopolies is another way a prospective Harris administration could attempt to fight price gouging. In the U.S., just four grocery chains control 70 percent of the market and most food items are produced by just a handful of manufacturers, making it easy for them to artificially keep prices high without illegally colluding. Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich points to meat prices as a prime example:\\n\\nAt the end of 2023, Americans were paying at least 30% more for beef, pork, and poultry products than they were in 2020.\\n\\xa0\\nWhy? Near-monopoly power! Just four companies now control processing of 80 percent of beef, nearly 70 percent of pork, and almost 60 percent of poultry. So of course, it\\'s easy for them to coordinate price increases.\\n\\xa0\\nAnd this goes well beyond the grocery store. In 75 percent of U.S. industries, fewer companies now control more of their markets than they did twenty years ago.\\n\\nThe Biden administration has already given Harris a head start on reducing the power of monopolies.It has attempted to block the merger of Kroger and Albertsons, has sued the company Agri Stats for giving meat processors an easy means of colluding, and has provided subsidies to regional chicken producers in an attempt to fight \"Big Meat\" and increase competition within the poultry industry.\\n But we should also look for solutions that are not limited by the constraints of the market. Bruenig, for instance, suggests that rather than simply capping Kroger\\'s prices, \"[a] better idea would be for the federal government to spend about $45 billion to purchase Kroger. This would allow it to directly set the prices for the second-largest grocery store chain in the country.\"\\xa0\\nAdditionally, a lot of the problems inherent to price controls seem to come from attempting to impose them while leaving every other facet of the market intact. Yes, if you limit prices, that may incentivize businesses to produce less. But the government also has tools that it has used in the past to remedy that problem in critical situations.\\xa0\\nMost notably, there\\'s the Defense Production Act, which was used during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that enough ventilators and N-95 respirators were available to the public. Joe Biden showed how it could be used to address shortages. In 2022, he invoked the DPA to order companies to speed up production amid a national baby formula shortage caused by contamination and supply chain bottlenecks. This power could theoretically be extended to correct any shortage, with the government simply declaring low supply or high costs an emergency.\\n \\n Regardless of what tools are used, I think it\\'s important that legislators feel at ease to think outside the typical \"Econ 101\" paradigm. Many of the arguments I\\'ve seen criticizing policies against price gouging seem to treat the vagaries of the free market as iron laws that cannot be questioned. Two years ago, the economist and YouTuber Cahal Moran wrote for this magazine that \"doctrinaire and one-eyed statements about how an imagined \\'basic economics\\' implies we can\\'t have nice things are the height of ideology. Most policies have both positive and negative effects, and the degree to which one outweighs the other will depend on careful case-by-case consideration.\" I think that sentiment applies here, too.\\xa0\\nRemember, the \"basic economics\" framework assumes that there is no such thing as price gouging at all. It not only assumes that prices are just natural outcomes of supply and demand, but that it\\'s a good thing companies have incentives to increase their prices as much as possible. (If you don\\'t believe me, the libertarian think tank Learn Liberty published a video last week arguing that \"Price Gouging is a Good Thing, Actually.\"\\xa0 I considered responding to this video myself, but my colleague Nathan J. Robinson responded to a similar version of this dreadful argument back in 2016 and I\\'d probably be repeating much of what he\\'s already said.) But I think the last few years, in which more families have come to struggle to meet their basic needs as a result of price gouging, have shown pretty unequivocally that it is deeply harmful.\\xa0\\nWe need to be willing to look outside the narrow parameters of what economic orthodoxy allows us to do. We should not ignore history either—we need to be aware of how past efforts to regulate the economy have failed and what can be improved upon. But in a fight to improve people\\'s lives, we should not take any tools off the table.\\n\\n'\n",

      "p_text = 'Read full articleInsider MonkeyJim Cramer Says Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN) \\'Has A Strong Long-Term Potential\\'Jose Karlo Mari TottocMon, Aug 26, 2024, 11:23 AM8 min readLink Copied1In this article:  We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Wants You to Check These 10 Stocks.\\xa0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) stands against the Jim Cramer-approved stocks.Jim Cramer noticed a strange pattern during the recent winning streak last week. According to Cramer, when a company reported earnings that were better than expected, its stock price would rise significantly. Even if the results were just a bit better than feared, the stock still went up. Conversely, if a company posted disappointing earnings, the market largely ignored it, believing it was just a temporary setback because the Fed might soon cut interest rates. This led to continued buying. However, this trend changed today as reality began to take hold.\"You see, we had a very odd pattern during the winning streak. It was a bit of Pangloss and a nip of Camelot. When a company reported a better-than-expected quarter, it was great. When a company reported a quarter that was just better than feared, the stock still rose. And when a company reported a bad quarter, we decided that it was the last bad quarter because the Fed was about to cut rates, so it was no big deal—buy anyway. In other words, companies could do no wrong, but not today. Today, we had a bit of a reckoning, a dose of reality.\"Jim Cramer pointed out that Tuesday\\'s market drop was anticipated because the S&P had been rising for eight straight days, and a ninth day would have been unusual, something not seen since 2004. The day was challenging, with the Dow falling 62 points and the S&P dropping 2%, which felt like a bigger loss. This raises concerns about whether the market can continue to rise, especially since negative news finally led to a decline after a strong eight-day rally.\"We were due for today\\'s modest pullback—the S&P had been up for eight straight days, and nine straight would have put us in rarefied territory. We haven\\'t seen that kind of winning streak since 2004. Today\\'s session was rough, with the Dow off by 62 points and the S&P dipping 2%, like losing 33%. We have to wonder if the market still has the momentum to go higher because today we got bad news, and guess what—stocks actually went down. That didn\\'t happen much during the 8-day gain.\"Jim Cramer observed that the market had been in a phase where strong performance drove stock prices up, and even poor results were overlooked because of the belief that the Fed would intervene. However, after seven days of gains, he suggested that this optimistic trend might be ending. The market has now reached a point where stocks no longer automatically benefit from positive bias.\"People had been reporting a perfect market scenario where good performance led to stock gains, and poor performance was cushioned by expectations that the Fed would step in to save the day. But after seven relentlessly positive days, we have to accept that stocks may no longer get the benefit of the doubt. We\\'ve reached a point where the market is sufficiently elevated, and we\\'re back to business as usual—where the good stocks rise, and the bad ones fall. At these high levels, we can\\'t just dismiss the bears with \"heads I win, tails you lose.\" There\\'s a return to rationality, and rationality is the enemy of a market where everything rallies indiscriminately.\"Cramer also mentioned that many investors are hoping for the Fed to step in during their meeting at Jackson Hole on Friday. If those expectations aren\\'t met, there could be significant selling pressure, particularly on a summer Friday. He noted that Lowe\\'s recently suffered because the market might be entering a phase where multiple rate cuts are necessary, but there\\'s no clear indication that such cuts are on the way. Without them, the company may struggle to turn its business around quickly.\"It doesn\\'t help that many expect the Fed cavalry to show up on Friday when they head to Jackson Hole. If things don\\'t go as expected, there could be a lot of selling, especially since it\\'s a summer Friday.\"Our MethodologyIn this article, we analyzed a recent episode of Jim Cramer\\'s Mad Money and selected ten stocks he talked about. We also included information on how hedge funds feel about each stock and ranked them based on the number of hedge funds that own them, from the fewest to the most.At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\\'s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) the Number One EV Stock Across the Globe?A state-of-the-art electric vehicle charging at a station at a suburban mall.Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)Number of Hegde Fund Investors: 37When a viewer asked Jim Cramer about Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), he explained that the company has solid long-term potential due to its significant backing, which reduces the risk of running out of money in the short term. Cramer noted that, while Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) will face challenges in scaling up its operations, he is not focusing on short-term fluctuations.\"I think Rivian has a strong long-term potential because they have significant backing and therefore are unlikely to run out of money in the short term. However, it will be a rocky road as they have many challenges to overcome to ramp up their operations. I\\'m not going to focus on short-term movements, but for someone like you, Henry, who has a long-term horizon, this might be a good investment opportunity.\"Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is poised for significant growth, driven by its successful expansion of production facilities. Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) has increased its production capacity at its Normal, Illinois plant and is building a new facility in Georgia, which will add the ability to produce 250,000 vehicles annually by 2025. Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)\\'s strong order backlog, including a notable 100,000 electric delivery vans fromAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), highlights substantial revenue potential and client confidence. Consumer demand is also robust, with over 90,000 pre-orders for the R1T and R1S models showing a positive market response.Strategic investments from Ford Motor Company(NYSE:F) and T. Rowe Price(NASDAQ:TROW), along with partnerships such as with Meridian Audio for premium sound systems, bring valuable capital and industry expertise. Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)\\'s ongoing research and development, including its advanced quad-motor system and the introduction of more affordable EV models, strengthens its competitive edge. Additionally, Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)\\'s commitment to sustainability through carbon-neutral manufacturing and the use of sustainable materials meets growing consumer and regulatory expectations.Meridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\"Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a US-based manufacturer of electric vehicles, namely the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV. They also have exposure to the commercial vehicle market with their electric delivery vans (EDVs) that are sold to companies like Amazon. The company has faced challenges amid the broader slowdown in electric vehicle demand and rising interest rates. This has contributed to Rivian underperforming expectations over the past few quarters. Rivian has also incurred losses as it continues to invest in the development of its products and manufacturing capabilities. We own Rivian in a hedged structure, which provides a significant margin of safety. Despite the near[1]term challenges, several factors provide optimism that Rivian can emerge as a long-term winner in the EV market. Rivian\\'s balance sheet is strong, with a substantial cash position that enables the company to continue investing in its growth and navigate through the current economic headwinds. Rivian is also unveiling the R2, which is a smaller and more affordable EV platform that will open the company\\'s products to a wider customer base. Lastly, Rivian\\'s investment in the enhancement of its production capabilities should improve the company\\'s manufacturing efficiency and drive a path to profitability. We continue to hold the company in a hedged structure.\"Overall RIVN ranks 9th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer wants you to check out. While we acknowledge the potential of RIVN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RIVN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\\xa0READ NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \\'Has Become A Wasteland\\'.\\xa0Disclosure: None.

They were beaming, eager to show their new sneakers to their friends at school.It had been a long time since Gonzalez, 41, had been able to afford new shoes for her children. The mother-of-six had been struggling to get by — bills were increasingly difficult to cover with her limited household income, which was a few thousand dollars a month between her and her fiancé. Seeing her daughters excitedly bring their Converse boxes up to the cash register was \"life-changing,\" she said.\\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider\\n                            subscribers.\\n                            Become an Insider\\n                            and start reading now.\\nHave an account? Log in.\\nGonzalez could afford that purchase because she was a participant in San Antonio\\'s guaranteed basic income program. The pilot gave 1,000 low-income participants an initial $1,908 payment in December 2020, followed by eight quarterly payments of $400 between April 2021 and January 2023. Gonzalez was one of 25 participants chosen to receive an additional $500 a month for 18 months through December 2024.For Gonzalez\\'s family, the pilot income meant being able to move from a motel to a rental home and more comfortably put food on the table. And, once her necessities were covered, she had a small amount of money left to buy her children something special: crayons and markers, Christmas gifts, and the new shoes. She said it made her feel \"worth something.\"\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\"It absolutely makes you feel 100% better about yourself — seeing that you can provide for your kids\\' needs,\" Gonzalez previously told Business Insider. \"But when you can provide for a want every once in a while, it just puts it over the top.\"Like San Antonio\\'s program, the overall GBI model offers participants recurring cash payments for a set period of time as an approach to poverty reduction. Participants typically receive between $50 and $2,000 a month, no strings attached, for one to five years. Over 100 pilots have been launched in cities across America, with many specifically focused on families.Gonzalez\\'s experience echoes that of many other basic income participants: Cash payments not only provide a monthly financial boost but allow some parents to afford toys and activities for their children — small purchases, they say, that have big impacts on their family\\'s quality of life.\\n\\n\\n                                Related stories\\n                              \\n\\n\\nParents say buying their children nonessentials improves quality of lifeIn contrast to traditional US safety nets like SNAP, housing vouchers, and Medicaid, guaranteed basic income programs place no requirement on how participants spend their money.\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\"You\\'re deciding what\\'s best for your family, you\\'re the expert on your family,\" Gonzalez said. \"Being able to utilize these funds in a manner that puts you back into control: it boosts your confidence.\"The participants BI spoke with predominantly use their payments for essentials. An analysis of 30 pilot programs involving nearly 8,300 participants found more than half of their payments went toward groceries, transportation, housing, utilities, healthcare, and education. The analysis reflects participant transactions made with a bank account or a debit card, which amounted to about 60% of their total spending. The analysis didn\\'t track how the participants spent cash.While some GBI pilots study changes in participants\\' happiness and mental health, those findings don\\'t specifically include how the extra things people purchased for themselves or their loved ones made them feel. To analyze quality of life impact, experts often look at individual anecdotes and qualitative findings, instead of just quantitative spending data on bills.For some of the parents BI spoke with, guaranteed basic income meant affording stable day care and a stroller to go on neighborhood walks. Others told BI they used the cash to buy a new crib and onesies for their newborn.\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMelvin Carter, member of the advocacy network Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, said it can be difficult to fully capture the quality of life improvements in a dataset because the benefits differ widely between participants. Still, he said it\\'s clear that cash aid has advantages.\"When parents have money to work with, children are better off,\" Carter, who is also the mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota, previously told BI.Basic income gave some families treats like dinners at restaurantsJeanette Fisher received $500 a month between summer 2022 and summer 2023 through Chicago\\'s GBI program. She mainly used the money to pay bills and sign a lease on a new apartment for herself and her daughter.But the 46-year-old single mom said she used some of her first payment to take her daughter, Sophia, to dinner and entertainment at Chuck E. Cheese. They hadn\\'t been since one of Sophia\\'s childhood birthday parties — it meant a lot to Fisher that they could celebrate together. It\\'s a memory they both treasure.\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\"She\\'s been through a lot,\" Fisher previously told BI. \"And she\\'s an amazing kid.\"Single moms in Birmingham, Alabama\\'s Embrace Mothers basic income pilot had a similar experience. Aside from using their $375 a month to pay bills and afford childcare, many of the 110 mothers spent a portion of their money on toys, dance classes, or holiday gifts for their children.Monica, a Birmingham participant who used only her first name for privacy, spoke to researchers for the program\\'s final report, which was published August 12. She said it\\'s \"amazing\" when she sees her two-year-old daughter happy.\"At the point when I started receiving the money, I started doing the thing where I give her surprises,\" Monica told researchers. \"So come the 15th, I\\'d take her to the Dollar Tree. And I teach her numbers, so I\\'d say: \\'Okay, mommy is going to allow you to have five items today. Let\\'s see if you can count five.\"\\'\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTo be sure, guaranteed basic income may not be a foolproof approach to poverty reduction. GBI programs are temporary, and it is not yet clear how cash payments impact participants in the months and years after the programs end. Some economists and politicians have said that GBI is too expensive for cities and philanthropists to finance over time.Not every family is going to spend guaranteed basic income in the same way, Carter said. But — whether parents are spending cash on meals, new shoes, or something else — he trusts that they are making the best decision for their family\\'s happiness.\"What we\\'re doing is betting on families, betting on families that are used to being bet against,\" Carter previously told BI. \"We\\'re betting on families\\' ability to know how to manage their money.\"Have you benefited from a guaranteed basic income program?

(Scott Stantis/For the Chicago Tribune)\\t\\t\\n\\nBy The Editorial Board | Chicago TribuneUPDATED: August 28, 2024 at 8:23 a.m.Donald Trump has proposed across-the-board tariffs on goods made abroad and sold in America, as well as substantial corporate tax cuts. Kamala Harris has proposed tax increases on corporations and the wealthy and a tougher federal response to what she deems \"price gouging\" by businesses.\\nWhat neither candidate has done so far when it comes to the nation\\'s economy is to address the actual challenges facing the federal government.\\nPresidential campaigns tend to be overly broad on economic policy, all the better to give the winner maximum flexibility to act on taxing and spending once they take office. But in the past candidates generally have spoken to the actual issues at hand. At this point in the 2024 election, voters aren\\'t even getting that much.\\nThe elephant in the room is that a substantial portion of the last major rewrite of the tax code, which Trump signed into law in 2017, will expire at the end of 2025. Most of the expiring provisions pertain to tax reductions for individuals. In order to enact as low of a corporate tax rate as possible (the GOP settled on 21%) while keeping within deficit financing limits, Trump and fellow Republicans in 2017 bet that Congress in 2025 would find it politically unpalatable to allow federal taxes on individuals to increase and would extend those cuts.\\nThat remains a good bet, but here\\'s the difference between then and now. The federal budget deficit when the Trump tax cuts were enacted was $665 billion. This fiscal year it\\'s approaching $2 trillion. The deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product in 2017 was 3.5%; this year it\\'s set to be 7%.\\nIf the country were in a deep recession or still reeling from the effects of the COVID pandemic, such profligacy might be justifiable. It is plainly irresponsible now, and neither candidate even mentions the deficit, much less suggests how to reduce it.\\nBoth campaigns are doing the voters a major disservice in failing to realistically address the issue of the nation\\'s fiscal woes and how they would handle the tax battle royale to come. The political adage, \"It\\'s the economy, stupid,\" happens to be true. Polls show Americans are most concerned about the state of their pocketbooks; much of that angst has been trained on the aftereffects of the post-COVID inflationary period that substantially raised the prices of necessities like food, insurance and utilities.\\nBoth candidates have pledged to bring prices down. Trump has made those promises without saying how he\\'d do it. His promise to impose an across-the-board 10% tariff on imported goods is one of the more concrete of his economic policies, and most economists believe such protectionism would be highly inflationary. Trump\\'s response is that the jobs created by giving American companies such a big boost would create economic growth that would more than make up for the costs. Our philosophical default there to back the free market. \\n\\n\\nHarris has offered a new clampdown on corporate \"price gouging,\" which has garnered brickbats even from some left-leaning pundits well aware of the history of price controls and the negative macroeconomic fallout they create.\\nThe truth is that consumers have done more to tame inflation than any government official ever could by changing buying habits. Companies selling name-brand everyday products now bemoan their lagging sales and are pivoting to appeal to cost-conscious consumers.\\nSo what should the federal government do to promote economic growth and stability? As is the case for households, it needs to get its fiscal house in order and set spending priorities. It\\'s worth retracing how we got to a point where nearly a third — yes, you read that right — of what the feds will spend this year is being put on the national credit card.\\nThe aforementioned Trump tax law was deficit-financed from the start. This page at the time thought that was a good risk to take in order to jolt what had been a slow-growth economy into something more dynamic. Republicans said sustainable 3% annual growth in gross domestic product was the goal. The economy never got there before the pandemic upended our economic life, and we\\'re not at that level today.\\nOne result that is undeniable, though, is that corporations have invested a large chunk of the tax windfall they\\'re enjoying into repurchasing their own stock; for many, financial engineering appears a better use of excess cash than investing in growth initiatives that lead to higher employment. Stock buybacks are on course to set a record this year and to top $1 trillion in 2025, according to Goldman Sachs.\\nThe Democrats have had a strong hand in inflating the deficit as well. Massive federal spending, first to soften the blow of COVID on businesses and households and then to finance the Biden administration\\'s debt-financed investments in infrastructure and green energy, significantly exacerbated the problem.\\nNo matter who wins the White House and which party controls Congress, there will be a sprawling tax bill next year, due to the overwhelming bipartisan desire to ensure there isn\\'t a tax hike on the majority of Americans through mere inaction. Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who represents a broad swath of the Chicago suburbs, told us in an interview during the Democratic National Convention that he believes even the liberal wing of his party understands those $2 trillion deficits can\\'t continue, even if few wanted to talk about that at the United Center.\\nWhen the time comes, the job of coming to terms on a package that apportions the tax burden fairly while simultaneously reducing the deficit will be made significantly easier if the winning campaign comes to the table with something resembling a thumbs-up from voters on how to accomplish that. There\\'s no way Trump or Harris will be able to do so if they don\\'t even acknowledge the issue will be one of the first items on the next president\\'s agenda and offer a broad-strokes idea of how to respond.\\nLikewise, the lack of any mention of the deficit by either candidate is, while perhaps politically strategic, a disservice to the country. We daresay only a sliver of the taxpaying public understands they\\'re financing close to a third of the federal budget with debt.\\nThe U.S. enjoys a special status as having the world\\'s leading currency and being the pre-eminent safe haven for global investors. But red ink like we\\'re seeing now isn\\'t sustainable.\\nSubmit a letter, of no more than 400 words, to the editor here or email letters@chicagotribune.com.\\n\\nOriginally Published: August 28, 2024 at 5:00 a.m.Share this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on X (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) \\n\\n \\n\\nMost PopularMost PopularEx-etiquette: Boyfriend was wearing a wedding ring at workEx-etiquette: Boyfriend was wearing a wedding ring at workAmy Jacobson steps down as Amundsen volleyball coach after controversial comments about Gus WalzAmy Jacobson steps down as Amundsen volleyball coach after controversial comments about Gus WalzChicago faces nearly $1 billion budget gap in 2025: \\'There are sacrifices that will be made\\'Chicago faces nearly $1 billion budget gap in 2025: \\'There are sacrifices that will be made\\'Niles bank on Dempster Street robbed Wednesday, police sayNiles bank on Dempster Street robbed Wednesday, police sayBeach volleyball returns to Chicago on Labor Day weekend — and features Olympic medalistsBeach volleyball returns to Chicago on Labor Day weekend — and features Olympic medalistsChicago Bears roster tracker: DT Sam Roberts among latest additions to the practice squadChicago Bears roster tracker: DT Sam Roberts among latest additions to the practice squadWalt\\'s Food Centers to leave South Holland after 87-year run, closing in late SeptemberWalt\\'s Food Centers to leave South Holland after 87-year run, closing in late SeptemberRetired Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood sells Winnetka mansion for $8.5M, making it that suburb\\'s highest-priced sale this yearRetired Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood sells Winnetka mansion for $8.5M, making it that suburb\\'s highest-priced sale this yearDaily Horoscope for August 29, 2024Daily Horoscope for August 29, 20246 things we learned from Chicago Bears GM Ryan Poles, including his belief in Matt Eberflus and satisfaction with Caleb Williams\\' growth6 things we learned from Chicago Bears GM Ryan Poles, including his belief in Matt Eberflus and satisfaction with Caleb Williams\\' growth \\n\\n\\n\\nTrending Nationally\\nMan drowns while rescuing 2 of his children in Delaware River in PoconosThis city tops U.S. News list of most expensive places to liveIt will soon be peak hurricane season.

      "p_text = 'HEALTHHospitality IndustryAdd TopicCEO got big bucks as his hospital chain imploded. Here\\'s who suffered. Ken AlltuckerUSA TODAYDonna Gittens felt drained as she struggled to form words. Dinner plans with her husband and friends would have to wait. She worried she was in the middle of a stroke.Gittens was rushed to Carney Hospital, minutes from her home in Boston\\'s Dorchester neighborhood. Last summer\\'s emergency spanned two facilities as physicians unraveled a medical mystery. The underlying issue was a brain infection, but she credits her neighborhood hospital\\'s doctors and nurses with saving her life.She now worries others in her area won\\'t have access to the same emergency care.Carney is one of two Massachusetts hospitals targeted for closure Aug. 31 following recent chaotic developments at Steward Health Care. The embattled for-profit hospital chain filed for bankruptcy on May 6 and has been mired in crises involving patients and creditors across several states.The chain is led by a former heart surgeon who collected more than $100 million in compensation and bought a $40 million yacht while employees at Steward hospitals complained about a lack of basic supplies, according to a Senate committee. More than 2,200 employees now expect to be laid off in Massachusetts and Ohio, according to notices filed with state regulators.The company\\'s CEO, who lawmakers say has declined multiple requests to answer questions voluntarily, is expected to appear under subpoena in mid-September before a Senate committee to address \"financial mismanagement\" at Steward.The case has raised broader issues for lawmakers and analysts about the role of private equity investments in health care. Many people from communities impacted by hospital closures are asking why there aren\\'t built-in protections when a corporation takes over an institution providing essential life-or-death services.The problem extends beyond Massachusetts. State health regulators in Arizona this month suspended operations at a Steward-owned psychiatric hospital after the air conditioning at the Phoenix facility cut off amid triple-digit temperatures. In West Monroe, Louisiana, hospital workers described searching the premises for basic medical supplies during procedures. One patient died at the hospital awaiting transfer to another hospital, resulting in an \"immediate jeopardy\" citation from regulators, according to testimony at a Louisiana House Health and Welfare Committee meeting in April.After the chain declared bankruptcy, the Massachusetts governor enacted an emergency plan to manage the disposition of its seven remaining hospitals there. The company sought and received approval from the bankruptcy court to shutter Carney and a second facility, Nashoba Valley Medical Center in Ayer, by the end of August.Gittens, who survived a health scare, worries her local neighborhood with a diverse, mixed-income population, will be left without essential medical care. During medical emergencies like hers last summer, timely care can be the difference between life and death.\"Carney is integral not only to my family – but the broader community,\" said Gittens.Despite pleas from neighborhood leaders, the state has no plans to keep Carney or Nashoba Valley open. However, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said at an Aug. 16 news conference the state plans to use eminent domain to take control of another Steward hospital, St. Elizabeth\\'s Medical Center in Brighton. The state has struck deals with other operators to run the other four Steward hospitals.Healey blamed Steward\\'s financial collapse on its CEO, Dr. Ralph de la Torre, and the hospital chain\\'s executives.\"This is not something that Massachusetts created,\" Healey said. \"It was created by the greed and the exploitation of an individual, Ralph de la Torre, and members of his team. De la Torre\\'s actions brought us to nearly the brink of collapse\" at Steward\\'s hospitals.A spokesperson representing de la Torre did not respond to questions from USA TODAY about allegations of problems at an array of Steward Health Care facilities.In a statement, the company said it would seek to minimize disruptions to patients.\"This is a challenging and very unfortunate situation, and the effect it will have on our patients, our employees, and the communities we serve is regrettable,\" the statement provided by Steward representative Deborah Chiaravalloti said. \"SHC (Steward Health Care) is doing all we can to ensure a smooth transition for those affected, while continuing to provide quality care to the patients we serve.\"Lawmakers cite \\'outrageous corporate greed\\'Steward Health Care was formed in 2010 when Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity firm, acquired a financially struggling nonprofit hospital chain from the Archdiocese of Boston. De la Torre, a Harvard Medical faculty member who previously led cardiac surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, became CEO of the new entity, named Steward Health Care.The Dallas-based company aggressively expanded to a chain of more than 30 hospitals employing more than 30,000 people. The expansion was fueled by a splashy deal engineered by de la Torre to sell the land underneath Steward\\'s hospitals to a corporate landlord, Medical Properties Trust. The sale-leaseback deal left the hospitals with hefty rent payments. Bankruptcy filings show the company is now reeling with $9 billion in debt, including more than $6 billion in lease payments to its landlord.After the bankruptcy filing in May, Steward announced plans to close hospitals and lay off thousands of workers, leaving community members who depend on the hospitals worried about where they will get care.The chain\\'s financial flameout captured the attention of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which authorized an investigation into the company\\'s financial dealings. The Senate probe is expected to include questions about Steward Health\\'s deal with private equity investors, its lavish spending, the lease deal and the hospital closures. The committee also issued a subpoena that compels de la Torre to answer questions about his company\\'s struggles.At a July 25 hearing, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, who chairs the committee overseeing the investigation, said de la Torre refused multiple invitations to testify before lawmakers, which prompted the bipartisan vote to order him to testify on Sept. 12.While Steward closed its hospitals, Sanders said, de la Torre was collecting a \"$100 million payday that he used to purchase a $40 million yacht.\" Sanders said the executive also bought a $15 million, custom-made fishing boat and had access to two private jets.De la Torre \"epitomizes the type of outrageous corporate greed that is permeating throughout our for-profit health care system,\" Sanders said at the hearing. \"Today we are saying enough is enough. It is time for Dr. de la Torre to get off of his yacht and to explain to Congress the financial chicanery which made him extremely wealthy, while the hospitals he managed went bankrupt.\"When asked which sources Sanders relied on for his July testimony about de la Torre\\'s compensation and boats, his staff provided links to articles in The American Prospect, The Boston Globe and Becker\\'s Hospital Review.Beyond Capitol Hill, Steward is being scrutinized by other entities. The Justice Department launched a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud and corruption at the company, CBS and other outlets reported. The Justice Department and the U.S. Attorney in Boston declined to comment on whether the health care chain was under investigation.Steward also has been investigated in the Mediterranean nation of Malta, where the company reached a $4 billion euro deal to manage three hospitals. In May, a Maltese magistrate recommended criminal charges against de la Torre. That probe involved the former prime minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, who was charged with money laundering, corruption and bribery. He has pleaded not guilty and faces up to 18 years in prison, according to local media.Your wallet, explained. Sign up for USA TODAY\\'s Daily Money newsletter.Private equity in health care scrutinizedThe bankruptcy, hospital closings and disruptions to patient care at Steward are not the only issues the Senate committee will probe. Sanders plans to seek answers into private equity\\'s growing stake in the health care sector.Sanders said at a July hearing private equity firms own 460 hospitals in the United States – or about 1 in 5 for-profit hospitals.\"How many of these hospitals are being loaded up with debt in order to make a handful of executives and private equity firms even wealthier?\" Sanders pondered aloud. \"How many of these hospitals are in danger of being shut down? How many patients are at risk?\"Experts say the Steward bankruptcy raises concerns about private equity\\'s involvement in the health care industry. Under the Steward model, the company\\'s debt became overwhelming as it acquired more hospitals and doctors\\' practices.The financial problems following Steward\\'s acquisition spree were inevitable, said Dr. Vikas Saini, president of the Lown Institute, a Massachusetts-based health think tank.Saini blames the chaos on the lack of regulatory oversight for health care mergers and acquisitions.\"It illustrates how moth-eaten our oversight and regulatory apparatus is for the health care sector,\" Saini said. He added that hospital takeovers have \"much more social impact, much more meaning to communities than whether or not an iPhone plant gets built.\"Hospital ownership changes require more guardrails, transparency and public scrutiny, Saini said. \"We\\'ve got to be sure that you\\'re not just selling us a bill of goods.\"Louisiana patients in \\'immediate jeopardy\\'In Louisiana, state health regulators scrutinized Steward-owned Glenwood Regional Medical Center, which was hit with three \"immediate jeopardy\" warnings in 120 days from December 2023 through early 2024. These citations described lapses that put patients\\' safety in jeopardy and could result in the termination of Medicare and Medicaid payments.Debra Russell, a Glenwood nurse practitioner, worked at the hospital for more than three decades before she quit last November.During an April hearing before a Louisiana legislative committee, she described the dire circumstances for patients at the hospital. She recalled having to switch tactics in the middle of a procedure because the hospital didn\\'t have a $5 tube called a guide wire. In another case, a young man came to the emergency room after a heart attack but staffers could not reach an on-call cardiologist because the specialist hadn\\'t been paid. When staff tried to order medication from the pharmacy for the patient, the drug wasn\\'t stocked because the hospital\\'s supplier hadn\\'t been paid.Evidence of the financial crunch also was visible outside the emergency room. Russell described coffee pots being repossessed and said document shredding companies had quit.Steward\\'s days of operating that hospital appear to be nearing an end. Steward has announced another hospital operator, American Healthcare Systems, has bid to purchase Glenwood. The bankruptcy court must approve the deal.Steward declined to answer questions about the sale or operations at Glenwood. In a news release issued last May, the hospital said it addressed issues raised by state and federal regulators following the immediate jeopardy warnings.During the Senate hearing this spring, Russell, the former Louisiana staffer, recalled her final days at the Steward-owned hospital as particularly gutting to witness.\"It\\'s the saddest thing I\\'ve ever been around,\" Russell said.Florida doctor sells to Steward; vendors don\\'t get paidDr. Charles Fischman thought he had sufficiently vetted Steward Health Care after executives approached him about purchasing his Vero Beach, Florida, medical practice in early 2017. The internal medicine doctor was nearing retirement age and considering his next steps. He wanted to make sure his 10,000 patients, two fellow doctors, a nurse practitioner and administrative staff were in good hands.When Fischman met with Steward executives, he said each leader was more charming than the next. He felt comfortable with the idea of a physician-led company acquiring his practice. Steward representatives talked to his employees over breakfast and eased their worries.\"We felt good about it,\" Fischman said.But weeks after Steward took over on June 1, 2018, problems surfaced, he said. Longtime vendors, such as lab suppliers, complained they had not been paid. The local water and power companies were within 24 hours of shutting off services due to unpaid bills.Under the terms of the acquisition, Fischman signed a two-year contract to remain as a physician and a lab director. Things didn\\'t improve in the following weeks and months, Fischman said.Fischman\\'s wife, Carol, who also worked at the office, fielded complaints from vendors – people the Fischmans knew personally after 30 years in the community. They wanted to get reimbursed for their services so they could pay their mortgages and cover other basic living expenses, he said.At a Vero Beach dinner meeting with some Steward executives months after the hospital chain bought the medical practice, Carol asked why the vendors\\' payments were delinquent. She didn\\'t get answers.\"All we heard were stories about fishing boats and hospitals in Malta,\" he said, recalling his conversations with Steward executives.His wife eventually quit in frustration. Fischman said executives pressured him to refer patients only to other Steward-employed physicians. He eventually left the practice in April 2020 and relocated to Tampa, where he still sees patients a few days a week.Chiaravalloti, of Steward, did not answer questions about the Vero Beach medical offices.Hospitals grapple with bankruptcy, closingsState health officials and medical community leaders from Massachusetts to Louisiana are now trying to assess how Steward Health Care\\'s bankruptcy will affect day-to-day operations, as new information about the company\\'s business dealings and practices continues to emerge.On Aug. 19, the Massachusetts governor\\'s office sent a letter to Steward describing Carney Hospital as an \"essential service\" for Dorchester residents, while acknowledging the state lacks the \"power to mandate\" the hospital remain open.Some community leaders are urging the governor to keep the hospital open nonetheless.Bill Walczak, a former president of Carney, said the Dorchester hospital has been plagued by \"terrible decisions\" going back decades, long before Steward took ownership.But he said Carney is worth saving to ensure access for up to 250,000 people who live in its service territory. He described it as a health equity issue for residents. Offering such a remedy is within the state\\'s purview, he said.\"Massachusetts is a very wealthy state, and it has a lot of power,\" Walczak said. \"If the legislature and governor and secretary of Health and Human Services wanted to put together a package today to preserve the essential services of the Carney Hospital, they could do it.\"Walczak noted the Healey administration vowed to use eminent domain to seize Steward\\'s St. Elizabeth\\'s Hospital in Brighton and transfer the facility to Boston Medical Center. The governor said Boston Medical Center\\'s willingness to take over St. Elizabeth\\'s was necessary to get the deal done. The hospital\\'s landlord, however, vowed to fight the seizure. The company that owns the property rejected Gov. Healey\\'s opening bid of $4.5 million to buy the location.Representatives of Healey and the state\\'s Department of Public Health did not immediately answer questions about next steps in the hospital seizure.Dorchester leaders want the governor to orchestrate a similar deal to keep Carney open.\"This is not over,\" Walczak said. \"Perhaps the governor will understand there are a lot of lives that would be put in jeopardy by not having an emergency room and beds, at a minimum, in this section of the city.\"Ken Alltucker is on X at\\xa0@kalltucker, contact him by email at alltuck@usatoday.com.Featured Weekly Ad'\n",

Also, about a third (34%) of adults who lived in a household experiencing a job loss used a credit card or a loan to handle price increases. Gen Z and millennials were the age groups most likely to use loans and credit cards to respond to higher prices. Besides relying more on credit cards, the Boston Fed said consumers were taking other measures to cut costs. Per its report, consumers have reduced their spending by eating less restaurant food, canceling subscriptions, purchasing less fresh produce and meat and switching to generic products. Survey respondents also reported contributing less to their savings, working more, moving to less expensive housing and delaying significant purchases. [Payments Dive]\n",

      "Retailers Are Making Millions from Cash-Back Fees, CFPB Says\n",
      "Three major retailers—Dollar General, Dollar Tree and Kroger—charge consumers more than $90 million annually via \"cash-back\" fees charged to access their own funds at a register, the CFPB said. While the cost to merchants for processing cash-back transactions \"may be a few pennies,\" fees passed on to consumers are often far higher. Among the examples highlighted were Dollar General and Dollar Tree, which charge $1 or more when customers withdraw less than $50 in cash. People living in rural communities or those without nearby bank branches commonly turn to retailers to get cash. Nearly 19 million people in the US were \"underbanked\" in 2021, according to the FDIC. The CFPB said cash is more often used by low-income consumers, racial minorities and older people.

      "3D Secure, or 3DS as it's sometimes called, is a credit card security technology that helps verify the authenticity of online transactions. It checks several factors to authenticate a purchase, including the user's location, the history of purchases on that card and whether the personal data provided during the transaction matches the bank's records. If the technology identifies any abnormalities during this verification process, it may use additional security checks via text message, email or phone call before completing the purchase. The goal of 3DS is to provide better transaction authentication to help everyone involved: customers, banks and online merchants. Users benefit from an improved experience with a simpler transaction. Banks benefit from reduced fraud and chargebacks. Merchants benefit by providing an easier process so that consumers actually complete the transaction and spend money with the merchant.

      "In early 2010, U.S. lawmakers gave what was supposed to be a gift to IRS agents with the grueling job of ensuring the wealthiest people and largest corporations pay their fair share of taxes. Tucked inside President Barack Obama's landmark Affordable Care Act was a new law that prohibited shifting money around for the sole purpose of avoiding taxes. This struck at the heart of the complex offshore tax maneuvers — the shell companies, sham trusts and dubious intercompany loans — that the affluent use to help keep billions of dollars from government coffers. Suddenly the notion that many of these schemes were technically legal was cast in doubt. Now it was up to the IRS to enforce the new law.\n",
      "In an era of government cuts and starved social services, this new law — known as the economic substance doctrine — was supposed to help U.S. tax authorities fight the estimated $688 billion a year in unpaid taxes. But then nothing happened. The IRS hardly touched its new weapon against high-end tax evasion — leaving billions of dollars on the table and its agents with little experience in using the law. But why?\n",
      "An investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists shows how, after coming under pressure from the industries that help wealthy people and corporations avoid taxes, the IRS's Large Business and International Division, or LB&I, issued a directive that blocked agents from using the economic substance doctrine.\n",
      "\"The IRS had this institutional view not to raise it,\" Monte Jackel, a tax attorney who has served several stints as a high-ranking IRS lawyer, said of the economic substance doctrine. \"For a decade or so, it was a dead letter — invisible.\"\n",
      "ICIJ found that this IRS directive not only echoed some of the key requests of powerful tax industry players, it also copied several sentences directly from an industry lobbying letter that had urged restrictions on the new law, turning the exact words of tax attorneys for the wealthiest people into official IRS policy. Among those who prepared the lobbying letter were at least four tax attorneys at the corporate law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, where the IRS official who issued the directive had recently worked. That official, Heather Maloy, has since risen to top brass at the IRS, overseeing all of its enforcement divisions.\n",
      "A congressional committee estimated that the new tax law was supposed to raise billions in revenue, meaning that the directive may have quietly cost the government large sums.\n",
      "The reporting adds to growing evidence that LB&I, the office tasked with policing the wealthiest taxpayers, often takes a deferential approach to these powerful players. It also sheds light on the prevalence in the leadership of the IRS and the Treasury Department of tax lawyers who have recently represented the sorts of wealthy taxpayers LB&I is supposed to regulate.\n",
      "In response to ICIJ's questions, the IRS emphasized that a recent inspector general report found that the agency did not give large multinational corporations preferential treatment. It also defended its handling of the economic substance doctrine and said that it values input from outside the government. \"A cornerstone element of fair and balanced tax administration is allowing those affected by IRS policies to have an opportunity to offer input,\" the agency said in an emailed statement to ICIJ. \"The tax system cannot operate in a vacuum, and we have a responsibility to give taxpayers the opportunity to be heard as we implement policy.\"\n",
      "ICIJ recently revealed that LB&I applies different and friendlier rules when auditing the wealthy as opposed to small businesses, and that its upper management shies away from even considering egregious tax-dodging cases for criminal referrals. The tiny number of such referrals from LB&I — no more than 22 in a recent span of five years — has frustrated some officials within the IRS's Criminal Investigation Division, who say they're often unsupported in identifying cases involving the biggest taxpayers.\n",
      "President Joe Biden's administration vowed to tackle high-end tax evasion and secured a historic $80 billion from Congress in part to fulfill this pledge. Now, with this infusion of funding, LB&I is being put to the test. The agency recently made a dramatic reversal in how it regards the economic substance doctrine, touting it as a key tool to stand up to powerful tax cheats.\n",
      "The IRS now has to play catch-up with its deployment of the doctrine, after letting it gather dust since 2010. At stake are not only billions in government revenue, but also the fate of a key Biden campaign promise to stand up to some of the world's wealthiest taxpayers.\n",

      "Fearful of the new law\n",
      "At least for the richest Americans, avoiding huge amounts of tax often comes down to paying well-heeled accountants and tax attorneys to create complex arrangements that exploit legal loopholes. Corporate tax advisers, though, fear the economic substance doctrine because it can cut through the artificial complexity at the center of many of these schemes.\n",
      "In the decades leading up to 2010, the economic substance doctrine lived informally in the court system. The government used the doctrine based on case law — i.e., the opinions of previous judges — to cobble together ad hoc and sometimes inconsistent ways of asserting it in tax cases.\n",
      "Lawmakers saw formalizing the doctrine in federal legislation as a crucial step to strengthen it as a deterrent to high-end tax evasion. The issue united Democrats and Republicans in the belief that the growing tax shelter industry posed a threat to the country's governance.\n",
      "For a decade, a group of U.S. senators tried repeatedly to make the doctrine official law and consequently faced fierce opposition from the industry representing private tax advisers. In 2003, then-Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said that legislating the doctrine would help fight the \"systemic corruption that plagues the accounting, legal and financial communities in the pursuit of tax shelters.\" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, a two-time chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, declared in 2007 that it was the \"right policy.\"\n",
      "Although its enactment into law in 2010 was eclipsed in the news by the larger health-care reform bill, high-end tax advisers quickly took notice.\n",
      "In public pronouncements, the industry warned that the legislation had ushered in a new world where the codified economic substance doctrine could \"dramatically change the tax enforcement landscape.\" Just hours after the law passed, the corporate law giant Skadden, which has represented some of the country's highest-profile tax evaders, warned that it \"will have an immediate effect on transactions in the planning stage\" and said \"taxpayers will need to proceed cautiously.\"\n",
      "The Big Four accounting firms — known to design highly complex structures of offshore shell companies for clients seeking to avoid taxes — also recoiled.\n",

      "\n",
      "PwC sought to shield itself from the potential impact of the economic substance doctrine.  Image: Michael Kappeler/picture alliance via Getty Images  \n",
      "\n",
      "Tax advisers should have difficult conversations with clients and take \"a back-to-basics, prudent course,\" warned an article in an industry publication co-authored by two tax accountants at accounting giant PwC.\n",
      "The Big Four firms began trying to shield themselves from the law's impact, according to documents leaked to ICIJ as part of the Paradise and Pandora Papers. In an agreement to provide tax services to a hedge fund using an entity in the British Virgin Islands, PwC stated it would not be liable for \"penalties imposed on you if any portion of a transaction is determined to lack economic substance,\" citing the 2010 law. In another tax services contract for a major private equity firm using shell companies in the Cayman Islands, Deloitte said it assumed no \"responsibility for any penalties resulting from client's failure to meet the requirements of the economic substance doctrine.\"\n",
      "Deloitte and PwC did not comment for this story.\n",
      "The law appeared to be changing the behavior of some of the largest firms. But would this last?\n",
      "Like Santa Claus\n",
      "Back in the U.S., the powerful tax law firms that work closely with the Big Four pressed the IRS to restrain its new powers. On Jan. 18, 2011, a group of eminent corporate tax lawyers sent a 66-page letter to then-LB&I Commissioner Maloy and other IRS executives. It urged the IRS to place extensive restrictions on the law that would, in practice, widely obstruct agents' ability to use it. The letter called the law's civil fines \"a significant stick\" and urged the IRS \"to be measured in how it swings this stick.\"\n",
      "This letter was written and reviewed by various prominent lawyers, including at least four tax attorneys at Skadden, the firm where Maloy had recently worked as a tax attorney. Two of those were partners at Skadden.\n",
      "It didn't take long for the private sector to get what it wanted from LB&I.\n",
      "On July 15, 2011, Maloy issued a directive that required agents take a series of steps and analyze more than two dozen factors before even asking for approval from a high-ranking IRS executive to use the new law. Agents had to notify the taxpayer as soon as they even considered asking for approval to pursue the economic substance doctrine, and then an IRS executive had to offer the taxpayer a chance to explain their position before the agent could receive approval to use the doctrine. The directive narrowed the scope of penalties agents could seek and defined how agents were generally supposed to analyze transactions — provisions sought by industry.\n",
      "By placing procedural hurdles in the way of using the doctrine, the directive effectively torpedoed a tax law that legislators had fought for a decade to pass. In addition to fulfilling key requests of industry players, the directive copied three sentences directly from the 66-page lobbying letter into official government policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "High-end tax attorneys celebrated the directive. A news bulletin on one tax law firm's website trumpeted: \"LB&I directive softens economic substance doctrine.\" Another firm declared that the steps imposed on agents will likely place \"a damper on the number\" of cases in which the doctrine could be used.\n",
      "Industry players themselves \"could not have written a more favorable set of audit guidelines than those in the new LB&I Directive,\" observed Jasper Cummings, a tax attorney with the law firm Alston & Bird LLP who co-authored the 66-page lobbying letter, in a memo posted to the firm's website.\n",
      "\"As a result of the Directive recently issued,\" Cummings added, \"the Economic Substance Doctrine will begin to share a key attribute of Santa Claus: to be more talked about than seen.\"\n",
      "In a memo posted to its website, Skadden described the directive as fulfilling hopes of the industry and said it provided a \"welcome assurance\" that the new law \"will not be asserted without considered review.\"\n",
      "Counsel said the approval process was too burdensome, so they didn't want to pursue it … They made it administratively impossible to use.\n",
      "One industry contributor to the 66-page lobbying letter said in a 2018 academic article that as a result of the Maloy directive, the \"economic substance doctrine arguably loses any deterrent effect … because taxpayers know that the IRS is unlikely to raise the economic substance issue.\"\n",
      "An LB&I agent who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the press said he worked on an audit several years ago in which a wealthy individual had dodged millions in taxes through a series of maneuvers that the agent believed could be challenged under the economic substance doctrine. But, the agent said, the July 2011 directive stopped him from using it, partly because of hesitance from the IRS attorneys he worked with.\n",
      "\"Counsel said the approval process was too burdensome, so they didn't want to pursue it,\" the agent told ICIJ.\n",
      "After this instance, the agent said that he did not try to use the doctrine again: \"They made it administratively impossible to use.\"\n",

      "'A revolving-door influence'\n",
      "For years, watchdogs and lawmakers have expressed concern about the potentially corrupting effects of individuals from the private tax industry ending up in high ranks of the IRS and its parent agency, the Treasury Department. Prominent tax attorneys from Big Four accounting firms or corporate law firms sometimes help implement favorable policies for their former clients. These officials often rejoin the private firms with rapid promotions.\n",
      "Earlier this year, ICIJ reporting showed that top executives in LB&I commonly switch hats from regulating the wealthiest taxpayers to working for them. A review of LB&I executive lists from the past 13 years shows that out of 114 top executives named, at least a quarter either had worked for a major accounting firm, a tax consulting firm or a major tax law firm shortly before joining the IRS, or left the IRS for such private sector roles.\n",
      "The IRS's watchdog, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), warned last year that the movement of employees between the IRS and accounting firms and big companies raised \"impartiality concerns.\"\n",
      "As the IRS embarks on a major hiring spree with its new billions, the questions around guarding against industry influence have gained new urgency.\n",
      "\"People from the private sector provide important viewpoints and unique expertise needed to help the IRS run the tax system,\" IRS spokesperson Robyn Walker told ICIJ in a statement for a previous story. \"This takes on even more importance as the agency works to build compliance work in high-risk corporate and high-wealth areas.\"\n",
      "The agency also told ICIJ that safeguards are in place to prevent conflicts of interest. These rules forbid officials from working on matters too closely related to their work for a former employer in the private sector. Yet these safeguards generally rely on these officials to proactively identify and declare such conflicts to the agency.\n",
      "In January 2022, TIGTA received an eight-page complaint from an agent alleging that Maloy's directive had been influenced by the private sector. The complaint alleged that \"we at the IRS are not enforcing our tax laws on multinational taxpayers using tax structures lacking economic substance.\"\n",
      "The complaint emphasized that the 66-page letter urging LB&I to restrict the new law was co-authored by attorneys at Skadden, Maloy's former employer, and alleged that the government was not enforcing its own rules around conflicts of interest.\n",
      "\"There's clearly a revolving door influence in play within the IRS,\" the complaint stated.\n",
      "\"Private sector attorneys from numerous firms known to be involved in promoting, opining, and defending abusive tax structures seized the opportunity to use revolving door colleagues in the executive ranks of the IRS to request, influence and craft guidance,\" the complaint also said. The complaint urged the inspector general to assist the IRS in reviewing and revoking the directive.\n",

      "One of the world's largest corporate law firms, Skadden has a tax practice that employs a former IRS commissioner and a former executive of LB&I. One of the authors of the 66-page letter, Brendan O'Dell, left Skadden in 2016 to spend six years in high-ranking positions within LB&I and Treasury before becoming the director of tax controversy for Amazon. Another of the letter's authors, Cary Douglas Pugh, left Skadden in 2014 to become a judge in federal tax court in Washington, D.C., making her among the most powerful people in tax law.\n",
      "The IRS agent's complaint to TIGTA has not been previously reported. Michael Welu, a former IRS agent who has been outspoken on the issues he saw within LB&I during his more than three decades at the IRS, provided a copy of the complaint to ICIJ. The complaint's author, Brian Visalli, is a special agent in the Criminal Investigation Division.\n",
      "\"While I'll confirm I'm a government whistleblower, I will not confirm or deny any specific complaints or documents I've provided to TIGTA,\" Visalli told ICIJ in a LinkedIn message. Visalli added that, due to concerns over retaliation, he would not comment further.\n",
      "In 2015, after almost six years of running LB&I, Maloy left the IRS to become the US Tax Controversy Leader at the Big Four accounting firm EY. EY's website from that time lists Maloy as a contact in relation to its services around a highly technical practice known as \"transfer pricing\" that is at the heart of some of the largest tax avoidance schemes.\n",
      "After five years at EY, Maloy returned to the IRS as a top executive in charge of the entire agency's compliance efforts. The heads of LB&I, Criminal Investigation and other major compliance divisions now report to her.\n",
      "ICIJ found that Maloy was not the only government official receiving policy requests from former private-sector colleagues related to the 2010 law. In January 2011, Lisa Zarlenga, then a tax partner at Steptoe & Johnson LLP — a corporate law firm that had opposed to the new law — was named as an author on the 66-page letter requesting restrictions on the IRS's use of the doctrine. Two of Zarlenga's colleagues at Steptoe, Mark Silverman and Amanda Varma, were also co-authors of the letter.\n",
      "But a similar letter co-authored by Silverman and Varma and sent just 3½ months later listed Zarlenga as a recipient. This was because Zarlenga had switched hats to become a high-ranking tax policy official at Treasury.\n",
      "In an interview with ICIJ, Zarlenga said she had nothing to do with Maloy's directive. \"Treasury would have had no involvement in that directive. I saw it when it was published in Tax Notes along with everyone else.\"\n",
      "In an interview after the the 2011 directive, Silverman — who had helped lead Steptoe's opposition to the doctrine — called the directive 'thoughtful' and \"extremely well done.\"\n",
      "Zarlenga, who now heads Steptoe's Tax Policy Practice, said that it's both common and important for the industry to weigh in on what the IRS is working on. \"Government officials interact pretty regularly with practitioners,\" she said. \"It's all part of the flow of information. Otherwise, the government attorneys are sort of sitting in an ivory tower and they don't know what is going on.\"\n",
      "New life for an old law\n",
      "Several months after TIGTA received the complaint in 2022, the IRS quietly rolled back the LB&I directive at issue, replacing it with a set of rules that stripped away a number of restrictions on agents' use of the economic substance doctrine. This was more than a decade after Congress passed the doctrine into law.\n",
      "The IRS did not respond to requests to comment on this story or answer questions about why it changed its rules around the doctrine in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the industry that had once applauded the directive sounded the alarm once more. In the wake of the new guidance, EY told its clients that \"taxpayers should focus on penalty protection\" and should consult tax professionals \"before entering into transactions with related parties\" — a technical term that generally means shifting assets or liabilities between entities all owned by a single person or business.\n",
      "In a post on its website, corporate law giant Baker McKenzie said the updated directive exemplifies what it called \"the IRS's increasingly offensive posture.\"\n",
      "The law firm was right. In August 2022, Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which included the $80 billion for the IRS to help fulfill his promise to make the wealthiest people and corporations pay their fair share of taxes.\n",
      "Despite its languid existence after being passed, the 2010 law has become a critical part of this effort. In June, the IRS announced an initiative to tackle tax abuse in the highly complex realm of investment partnerships, which have become a key means for the richest people on Earth to increase their wealth while minimizing the U.S. government's slice of the pie. In announcing the move, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen raised eyebrows by stating that \"many of these transactions violate the codified economic substance doctrine\" — a clear shot at the tax planners serving the ultrawealthy.\n",

      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.  Image: Justin Tallis - WPA Pool/Getty Images  \n",

      "Following through on this tougher rhetoric may be difficult, though. Recent ICIJ reporting showed that LB&I often takes an accommodating approach toward the largest taxpayers. Over the past five years, the division flagged no more than 22 instances of possible tax crimes for criminal investigators to review further — out of trillions of dollars in annual income from large corporations and ultrawealthy people that the office oversees. The IRS office that covers small businesses and self-employed people flagged roughly 40 times more possible crimes.\n",
      "In the agency's own comments to ICIJ for earlier stories, the IRS suggested that large corporations break the law less often than other types of businesses, saying their checks and balances and their use of independent accountants \"generally limit the opportunity for criminal activity.\" ICIJ found that the agency treats these powerful taxpayers accordingly.\n",
      "On Wednesday, TIGTA released an extensive report on the IRS's challenges to stand up to tax evasion by multinational corporations and addressed frustrations of agents around the difficulty of using the economic substance doctrine. The report also said that the IRS's 2022 change to the directive was \"a result of gaining experience and a level of comfort in the application of the doctrine.\" It added that \"the IRS could not provide us with the number of cases where examination teams considered the Economic Substance Doctrine.\"\n",
      "The report, which was premised on determining whether the IRS gives multinational corporations preferential treatment, said it found no instances of such treatment. It did, however, recommend that LB&I review its procedures around enforcement of multinational taxpayers, including around its use of the economic substance doctrine.\n",
      "Experts say that the decade when the doctrine lay dormant may put the office at a disadvantage for a number of reasons. One is that the IRS's agents and attorneys have little experience using it and could be forced into a trial-and-error approach. Some commentators say that, despite all of the commotion around the law, it may be vulnerable to legal challenges. The previous dearth of cases involving the new law also means that judges are just now getting the chance to issue significant rulings on it. The way judges interpret any tax law sends important signals to the IRS about how to pursue winning legal arguments in court — where they face tax attorneys for large corporations and the ultrawealthy known to spend massively to defeat the IRS.\n",
      "\"They haven't had a lot of experience in actually applying it in real-world cases or seriously thinking about it,\" Jackel, the tax attorney, said of the 2010 law. \"It will be a slow process for them to get up to speed on it and be confident in their ability to assert the doctrine.\"\n",

      "Engineering a $2.4 billion deduction\n",
      "Some of the IRS's cases using the 2010 law are beginning to make their way through the courts. Most significant of these is the agency's attempt to invalidate a $2.4 billion tax deduction claimed by Liberty Global, the multinational telecommunications firm led by billionaire John C. Malone. With a net worth of roughly $9.8 billion, Malone is the largest voting shareholder in Liberty Global and is listed by Bloomberg as the second largest private landowner in the U.S., holding some 2 million acres across the country.\n",
      "In 2020, Liberty Global asked the IRS for a $110 million refund for overpaying its 2018 taxes. The massive refund request was based on a complex series of maneuvers — involving shuffling assets between subsidiaries in places like Belgium, the Netherlands and Slovakia — that had been created by Liberty Global's tax department with help from Deloitte. In challenging the refund request, Justice Department lawyers alleged that the entire point of the transactions was to improperly exploit a new loophole in federal tax law.\n",

      "\n",
      "Liberty Global's tactics did not emerge out of thin air. In one filing, the Justice Department noted that the \"situation arises because tax litigators have been developing strategies\" like Liberty Global's. In emails contained in court records, Liberty Global's tax department discussed paying Deloitte and another Big Four firm, KPMG, hundreds of thousands of dollars for their work on the complex international tax structures. The Justice Department attorneys noted that Skadden had publicly endorsed a refund tactic similar to that of Liberty Global.\n",
      "Skadden did not respond to a request for comment.\n",
      "In October 2023, the IRS won its case against Liberty Global, with a federal judge in Colorado ruling that the company's use of a loophole was not permitted under the 2010 law.\n",
      "That ruling was \"the worst nightmare for tax planners who rely on 'catching' Congress in a glitch in the law,\" wrote Jasper Cummings, the tax attorney at Alston & Bird. \"This Liberty Global opinion is by far the scariest [economic substance doctrine] opinion of recent times and shows a Justice Department unleashed from the historic norms of the income tax.\"\n",
      "Liberty Global maintains that its tax reporting in connection with the case was correct. Although Liberty Global had acknowledged that the maneuvers did not have any true business purpose apart from avoiding taxes, according to court documents, it appealed the ruling in April on technical grounds around applying the doctrine. The firm's lawyers said \"the court fundamentally misunderstood\" the case and asserted that the IRS \"wrongly wields the economic substance doctrine to rewrite, rather than interpret, the law.\"\n",
      "If Liberty Global prevails in its appeal, it could create a precedent, perhaps as high as with the U.S. Supreme Court, that would weaken the IRS's use of the doctrine moving forward.\n",

      "In a campaign speech earlier this month, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris laid out several new planks of her economic agenda. Among them were expansions to the child tax credit, subsidies for homebuyers, and caps on prescription drug costs. But the policy that seems to have the most people talking is Harris's proposal for the \"first-ever federal ban\" on price gouging for food and groceries.\n",
      "\n",
      " According to Forbes, grocery prices have increased 27 percent since July 2019. And while inflation has cooled back to roughly pre-pandemic levels, American families are still feeling the pinch, spending the greatest percentage of their household budgets on food in three decades, according to the Department of Agriculture. If you shop for groceries, you've surely seen it: A carton of grade-A eggs that cost $1.40 five years ago now costs more than $3 on average. A gallon of milk that cost just under $3 now costs nearly $4. And a pound of beef that cost less than $4 now costs around $5.50.\n",
      " Polls show that inflation is still the number-one issue voters are worried about, and Harris is attempting to address that concern. While the major spikes in inflation that took place over the first two years of the Biden administration were multifaceted, with supply-chain hiccups, the war in Ukraine, and increased demand from a strong labor market all playing a role, Harris is making the case that price gouging by large corporations was also to blame. \"Many big grocery chains that have seen production costs level off have nevertheless kept prices high,\" says a fact sheet from her campaign. To deal with this problem, Harris says she plans to \"set clear rules of the road to make clear that big corporations can't unfairly exploit consumers to run up excessive profits on food and groceries\" and \"secure new authority for the [Federal Trade Commission] and state attorneys general to investigate and impose strict new penalties on companies that break the rules.\" \n",
      " Harris's rollout of this policy has been widely panned in the press. The libertarian magazine Reason called it \"dishonest and stupid,\" which is unsurprising coming from them, but even more mainstream publications haven't been much kinder, with the Atlantic's Josh Barro calling Harris's plan \"economically dumb\" and saying her \"promises make no sense to people acquainted with supply and demand.\" Positive write-ups, like Nick Hanauer's in the New Republic, have been the exception rather than the rule. The skepticism is not entirely unwarranted. For the moment, Harris's policy is frustratingly vague. Nowhere has she defined the term \"price-gouging,\" nor has she given any parameters for what constitutes \"excessive profits,\" which makes it hard to give her particular ideas for tackling the problem a critical evaluation. Additionally, 37 U.S. states already have some form of price gouging law on the books. Harris needs to clarify what exactly her proposal would do that these laws have failed to do. \n",
      " But a lot of commentators have taken issue not with the policy's lack of detail, but with its very premise. As you'd expect, conservatives including Donald Trump are running with the line that proposing price controls proves Harris is a \"communist.\" (A line that only makes sense, Newsweek points out, if you are also willing to call Richard Nixon a communist.) Allison Schrager of the right-wing Manhattan Institute has stated that Harris was reviving the \"price-gouging myth\" and that her policy was \"the wrong solution to a nonexistent problem.\"\n",
      "Even liberal publications have taken a similarly derisive tone. In an August 15 editorial, the Washington Post's Catherine Rampell suggested that conservatives had a point when calling Harris's plan \"communist,\" and said that the Vice President was \"exploiting [inflation] for demagogic gain because push-polling suggests people are mad about 'greed.'\" In USA Today, Nicole Russell wrote that \"No one with a half-way functioning brain thinks that inflation, which caused high prices, at the local grocer is due to price gouging by corporations.\" CNN's news article on the policy, which carries the rather opinionated headline that \"Harris' plan to stop price gouging could create more problems than it solves\" is a touch more charitable, saying that \"many economists contend corporate profits were juiced by that thing you learned in Econ 101: supply and demand—not corporate greed (alone, anyway).\"\n",
      "It would be one thing if these articles simply argued that Harris's proposed method to combat price gouging was faulty or ill-considered. I don't think the contours of the policy are clear enough yet to make that judgment, but these writers are certainly free to give their predictions. But the writers don't just argue that Harris is wrong about how to fight price gouging. They seem to think that the mere idea of price gouging is laughable, something that nobody with even a basic degree of economic literacy could believe is a real problem.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Except that's obviously not true. We know that companies have dramatically increased their profits on the backs of consumers in the last few years. Pointing to an increase in corporate profits from 9.7 percent of America's total GDP in 2020 to 11.2 percent in 2023, Hanauer estimates that companies \"have gouged their way to an almost unbelievable $1.5 trillion in excess profits since 2020—that's in addition to their pre-pandemic profit rates.\" This means that price gouging has cost American families $12,000 on average in that time frame.\n",
      "Food manufacturers have attempted to justify increasing prices by pointing to the increased costs of labor and materials, as well as supply chain hiccups that created shortages. If companies were only raising their prices to accommodate rising input costs, this would make sense. But grocery stores and manufacturers have both been bringing in considerably bigger profits than they did before the pandemic. \n",
      "Some of the price increases have come from profits at the retail level. According to a report from the Federal Trade Commission, food and beverage retailers increased their revenues from 5.6 percent above their total cost in 2015 to more than 6 percent in 2021 and 7 percent in 2023. And according to Forbes, \"The top 10 retailers increased their combined profits by over $10 billion [in 2021 and 2022] and issued over $15 billion in shareholder buybacks.\" And on Tuesday, a Kroger pricing executive, Andy Groff, even admitted during questioning at an FTC hearing that the company's objective was to \"pass through our inflation to consumers\" and that \"on milk and eggs, retail inflation has been significantly higher than cost inflation.\"\n",
      "Meanwhile, a lot of gouging happened at the manufacturer level too. Reporting from April 2023 by Nik Popli, in Time magazine, provides several examples of major companies that saw historic windfalls in the pandemic's aftermath: \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "At Kraft-Heinz, the multinational food company that makes Oscar Mayer, Jell-O, and Kool Aid, profits for the quarter ending at the end of 2022 were up nearly 450%, compared to the prior year, at $887 million. Tyson Foods, the largest meat company in the U.S., more than doubled its profits between the first quarters of 2021 and 2022. And General Mills, which owns Kix, Trix, and Chex among other recognizable cereal labels, saw its fourth quarter profits last year rise 97% compared to the previous quarter. \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "Even four years after the initial shock of the pandemic, many companies that raised their prices have not brought them back down. For example, even as input costs dropped in 2023, PepsiCo announced that they would not bring their prices back down to accommodate it. In fact, they did the opposite, increasing prices by double digits in 2023 and 2024. The Groundwork Collaborative, a group of progressive economists, has found this to be true across the economy as a whole. \"Corporate profit margins,\" they wrote in a study published in January, \"have remained high and even grown—as labor costs have stabilized, nonlabor input costs have come down, and supply chain snarls have eased.\" Looking at inflation from April to September 2023, they found that corporate profits accounted for 53 percent of the increase in consumer prices, compared with just 11 percent forty years before the pandemic. \n",
      "Another study, from the U.K.-based think tanks Common Wealth and the Institute for Public Policy Research, looked at the financial statements of companies from the U.S., U.K., European Union, Brazil, and South Africa. It determined that across the period from 2019 to 2022, the U.S. experienced 9 percent inflation while the Eurozone experienced 11 percent. But at the same time, corporate profits increased by anywhere from 32 to 44 percent depending on the country. Fortune magazine described this pattern as evidence that companies were \"lying to you about inflation.\"\n",
      "It's not just lefty think tanks reaching these conclusions. The International Monetary Fund (not exactly a cabal of hardened communists) looked at inflation across the Eurozone in 2022 and found that 45 percent of it could be attributed to \"domestic profits.\" The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City reached a similar conclusion about inflation in the U.S., stating that \"markup growth,\" that is, the increase in the ratio of how much a firm charges vs. production costs, \"was a major contributor to inflation in 2021.\" This and other economic analyses demonstrating such astonishing profiteering even surprised some in the belly of the beast. Albert Edwards, a strategist at one of Europe's oldest investment banks, Société Générale, said the following in April 2023:\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "After working in finance for over 40 years I had felt there wasn't much that could surprise me. Yet I find the unprecedented levels of corporate Greedflation in this economic cycle astonishing. The latest release of US whole economy profits data delivered another shock to my weakening confidence that the capitalist system is working as it should.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Another criticism of Harris's crusade against \"price gouging\" is the idea that grocery prices are no longer a problem because the rate of inflation has settled back to normal levels. While this is true that inflation has cooled, it's not actually helpful in terms of high food prices. Inflation is the rate of increase, so when grocery costs rise dramatically for years and then stop, it might technically be true that \"inflation has gone down\"—but we're still stuck with the price increases from the past years, and Americans are still paying a greater percentage of their incomes for groceries than they were five years ago. And this doesn't even begin to address the fact that the costs of other major expenses like housing, energy, medical care, and transportation have also grown considerably. An Urban Institute study from 2023 found that in order to pay for groceries, families were increasingly going into credit card debt, relying on apps like Buy Now, Pay Later, or even taking out predatory payday loans.\n",
      " To be clear, groceries are just one of many areas where the government should intervene to make life more affordable, and addressing price gouging on food should not come at the expense of addressing it in other areas of life. (To her credit, Harris has proposed policies of varying quality and specificity to address childcare, housing, and prescription drug costs too. In Jacobin, Matt Bruenig has a useful article breaking each of them down.)\n",
      " It's clear, however, that food manufacturers and retailers got away with screwing us badly over the past few years. The New York Times reported earlier this year that a lot of companies have been \"testing the limits\" of how much they could charge consumers, and found there were fewer than they once thought: \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Big companies that had previously pushed through one standard price increase per year are now raising prices more frequently. Retailers increasingly use digital price displays, which they can change with the touch of a button. Across the economy, executives trying to maximize profits are effectively running tests to see what prices consumers will bear before they stop buying.\n",
      " \n",
      "Huge disruptions to supply chains pushed up corporate costs during the pandemic and forced many companies to think more creatively about their pricing strategies, [Alexander MacKay, coleads the Pricing Lab at Harvard Business] said. That supercharged a trend toward more rigorous pricing, and showed many companies that they could more boldly play with prices without chasing shoppers away. The experimentation continues even as costs ease.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Stores like Walmart and Kroger, meanwhile, are increasingly exploring the possibilities of so-called \"dynamic pricing,\" a practice similar to the \"surge pricing\" that makes Uber and Lyft rides cost more at peak hours. As a letter from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bob Casey warns, digital price labels may soon be used to \"rais[e] prices suddenly and at times when certain products are in highest demand,\" such as \"the price of turkeys in the days leading up to Thanksgiving, or the price of ice cream on a hot day.\"\n",
      " Inflation may have come back to normal—more or less—but it's only a matter of time before the next economic crisis comes around. We need to have guardrails in place to make sure that companies can't take advantage. So what can be done?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " After getting flogged in the press, the Harris campaign has attempted to reject any notion that they are proposing sweeping, industry-wide \"price controls.\" The campaign has suggested, in characteristically vague terms, that Harris's policy would more closely mirror already existing state laws that prevent jacking up the prices of certain goods in cases of emergency—\"the sort of laws that prevent stores from quadrupling the price of snow shovels right after a blizzard hits,\" as the New York Times says.\n",
      " It's hard to know whether Harris and her team are backtracking, or if the campaign left the policy intentionally vague to test the response. But regardless, it's a shame to see them so responsive to media backlash and obvious bad-faith attacks from Republicans, who will call them communists no matter what they propose. \n",
      "It's also a shame that Democrats are so quick to summarily dismiss the idea of broader price controls. This is a needless concession to the orthodoxy of \"Economics 101,\" which is usually more conventional wisdom than actual fact. Indeed, many of the arguments I have seen thrashing Harris at the mere suggestion that she may impose \"price controls\" rely heavily on their theoretical shortcomings in a utopian market dreamscape rather than how they've actually played out in reality. Let's take Rampell's argument in the Washington Post. She suggests that Harris would likely model a piece of price gouging legislation off a bill introduced by Elizabeth Warren in 2020 (a fair assumption at the time, since Harris had not yet backed off the idea of wide-reaching price controls). Rampell writes: \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "It's hard to exaggerate how bad this policy is. It is, in all but name, a sweeping set of government-enforced price controls across every industry, not only food. Supply and demand would no longer determine prices or profit levels. Far-off Washington bureaucrats would. The FTC would be able to tell, say, a Kroger in Ohio the acceptable price it can charge for milk.\n",

      "There are a few obvious red flags here. For one thing, there's the simplistic dichotomy of good, natural, virtuous \"supply and demand\" being subverted by the big, scary \"far-off Washington bureaucrats\" who seek to \"control prices.\" Really, all prices are the result of choices from someone. The only question is who. A Kroger pricing manager's only incentive is to maximize the company's profits by charging as much as they believe they can get away with. At least a \"far-off Washington bureaucrat\" would face some mechanism of democratic accountability. \n",
      "Rampell also brings up the dangers of shortages, which is another common argument against price controls. The theory goes that by limiting the price a producer can charge, you limit their incentive to produce. We've seen instances of this before: Rampell links to a story from Argentina in 2007, where retailers could not find cattle farmers who were willing to sell beef to them at government prices. If you go back further, to World War II, you can find stories of meat producers packing sausages with \"soybeans, potatoes, or cracker meal\" and selling muskrat steaks to save money due to the government suppression of meat prices.  \n",
      " For the era of greedflation, a possible alternative solution to capping prices would be to instead cap profits. As historian Uwe Fuhrmann writes, this is something that West Germany did to curb inflation after World War II: \"the authorities established legally binding 'maximum prices for end consumers' and capped profit margins at 20 percent. Only after this combination of price controls and revenue caps did prices finally go down…\" \n",
      " But there are also plenty of modern examples of price controls being used successfully in the United States. Rent controls are some of the best examples, as catalogued by Mark Paul last year in the American Prospect:\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "One study of rent control in New Jersey—a state with a rich history of embracing rent control—found that, over three decades, rent control increased housing supply (though this was largely attributed to landlords slicing up larger units into smaller ones). Other studies have repeatedly confirmed that rent control doesn't affect the overall supply of housing, though landlords may take advantage of poorly written rent control laws that allow them to convert existing rentals into condos to better capture price increases and skirt the intentions of rent control laws—loopholes that could easily be shut […]\n",
      " \n",
      "There are further benefits that the conventional wisdom misses. One, rent control works; as study after study has shown, rent regulation keeps housing more affordable. In Massachusetts, researchers have found that tenants in controlled units pay just half as much in rent as those in non-controlled units of similar size and quality. On the opposite coast, L.A. renters in regulated units pay one-quarter to one-third less in rent than those in nonregulated units—meaning hundreds of dollars a month in savings for households often living paycheck to paycheck.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "You've also probably heard that Medicare recently \"negotiated\" the price of expensive prescription drugs. This is effectively an example of the government using its outsized influence as a buyer of these drugs to control prices. Separately, as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration also imposed more direct \"inflation penalties\"—price controls, in other words—on 64 drugs whose prices increased faster than the rate of inflation. And it introduced a $35/month cap on insulin for Medicare patients, which has been so popular that Donald Trump is trying to take credit for it.\n",
      "So when it comes to capping the price of groceries, we shouldn't be so quick to dismiss price controls out of hand. But that doesn't mean they are the only solution to inflation either. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Breaking up food monopolies is another way a prospective Harris administration could attempt to fight price gouging. In the U.S., just four grocery chains control 70 percent of the market and most food items are produced by just a handful of manufacturers, making it easy for them to artificially keep prices high without illegally colluding. Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich points to meat prices as a prime example:\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of 2023, Americans were paying at least 30% more for beef, pork, and poultry products than they were in 2020.\n",
      " \n",
      "Why? Near-monopoly power! Just four companies now control processing of 80 percent of beef, nearly 70 percent of pork, and almost 60 percent of poultry. So of course, it's easy for them to coordinate price increases.\n",
      " \n",
      "And this goes well beyond the grocery store. In 75 percent of U.S. industries, fewer companies now control more of their markets than they did twenty years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Biden administration has already given Harris a head start on reducing the power of monopolies.It has attempted to block the merger of Kroger and Albertsons, has sued the company Agri Stats for giving meat processors an easy means of colluding, and has provided subsidies to regional chicken producers in an attempt to fight \"Big Meat\" and increase competition within the poultry industry.\n",
      " But we should also look for solutions that are not limited by the constraints of the market. Bruenig, for instance, suggests that rather than simply capping Kroger's prices, \"[a] better idea would be for the federal government to spend about $45 billion to purchase Kroger. This would allow it to directly set the prices for the second-largest grocery store chain in the country.\" \n",
      "Additionally, a lot of the problems inherent to price controls seem to come from attempting to impose them while leaving every other facet of the market intact. Yes, if you limit prices, that may incentivize businesses to produce less. But the government also has tools that it has used in the past to remedy that problem in critical situations. \n",
      "Most notably, there's the Defense Production Act, which was used during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that enough ventilators and N-95 respirators were available to the public. Joe Biden showed how it could be used to address shortages. In 2022, he invoked the DPA to order companies to speed up production amid a national baby formula shortage caused by contamination and supply chain bottlenecks. This power could theoretically be extended to correct any shortage, with the government simply declaring low supply or high costs an emergency.\n",
      " \n",
      " Regardless of what tools are used, I think it's important that legislators feel at ease to think outside the typical \"Econ 101\" paradigm. Many of the arguments I've seen criticizing policies against price gouging seem to treat the vagaries of the free market as iron laws that cannot be questioned. Two years ago, the economist and YouTuber Cahal Moran wrote for this magazine that \"doctrinaire and one-eyed statements about how an imagined 'basic economics' implies we can't have nice things are the height of ideology. Most policies have both positive and negative effects, and the degree to which one outweighs the other will depend on careful case-by-case consideration.\" I think that sentiment applies here, too. \n",
      "Remember, the \"basic economics\" framework assumes that there is no such thing as price gouging at all. It not only assumes that prices are just natural outcomes of supply and demand, but that it's a good thing companies have incentives to increase their prices as much as possible. (If you don't believe me, the libertarian think tank Learn Liberty published a video last week arguing that \"Price Gouging is a Good Thing, Actually.\"  I considered responding to this video myself, but my colleague Nathan J. Robinson responded to a similar version of this dreadful argument back in 2016 and I'd probably be repeating much of what he's already said.) But I think the last few years, in which more families have come to struggle to meet their basic needs as a result of price gouging, have shown pretty unequivocally that it is deeply harmful. \n",
      "We need to be willing to look outside the narrow parameters of what economic orthodoxy allows us to do. We should not ignore history either—we need to be aware of how past efforts to regulate the economy have failed and what can be improved upon. But in a fight to improve people's lives, we should not take any tools off the table.\n",

      "Read full articleInsider MonkeyJim Cramer Says Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN) 'Has A Strong Long-Term Potential'Jose Karlo Mari TottocMon, Aug 26, 2024, 11:23 AM8 min readLink Copied1In this article:  We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Wants You to Check These 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) stands against the Jim Cramer-approved stocks.Jim Cramer noticed a strange pattern during the recent winning streak last week. According to Cramer, when a company reported earnings that were better than expected, its stock price would rise significantly. Even if the results were just a bit better than feared, the stock still went up. Conversely, if a company posted disappointing earnings, the market largely ignored it, believing it was just a temporary setback because the Fed might soon cut interest rates. This led to continued buying. However, this trend changed today as reality began to take hold.\"You see, we had a very odd pattern during the winning streak. It was a bit of Pangloss and a nip of Camelot. When a company reported a better-than-expected quarter, it was great. When a company reported a quarter that was just better than feared, the stock still rose. And when a company reported a bad quarter, we decided that it was the last bad quarter because the Fed was about to cut rates, so it was no big deal—buy anyway. In other words, companies could do no wrong, but not today. Today, we had a bit of a reckoning, a dose of reality.\"Jim Cramer pointed out that Tuesday's market drop was anticipated because the S&P had been rising for eight straight days, and a ninth day would have been unusual, something not seen since 2004. The day was challenging, with the Dow falling 62 points and the S&P dropping 2%, which felt like a bigger loss. This raises concerns about whether the market can continue to rise, especially since negative news finally led to a decline after a strong eight-day rally.\"We were due for today's modest pullback—the S&P had been up for eight straight days, and nine straight would have put us in rarefied territory. We haven't seen that kind of winning streak since 2004. Today's session was rough, with the Dow off by 62 points and the S&P dipping 2%, like losing 33%. We have to wonder if the market still has the momentum to go higher because today we got bad news, and guess what—stocks actually went down. That didn't happen much during the 8-day gain.\"Jim Cramer observed that the market had been in a phase where strong performance drove stock prices up, and even poor results were overlooked because of the belief that the Fed would intervene. However, after seven days of gains, he suggested that this optimistic trend might be ending. The market has now reached a point where stocks no longer automatically benefit from positive bias.\"People had been reporting a perfect market scenario where good performance led to stock gains, and poor performance was cushioned by expectations that the Fed would step in to save the day. But after seven relentlessly positive days, we have to accept that stocks may no longer get the benefit of the doubt. We've reached a point where the market is sufficiently elevated, and we're back to business as usual—where the good stocks rise, and the bad ones fall. At these high levels, we can't just dismiss the bears with \"heads I win, tails you lose.\" There's a return to rationality, and rationality is the enemy of a market where everything rallies indiscriminately.\"Cramer also mentioned that many investors are hoping for the Fed to step in during their meeting at Jackson Hole on Friday. If those expectations aren't met, there could be significant selling pressure, particularly on a summer Friday. He noted that Lowe's recently suffered because the market might be entering a phase where multiple rate cuts are necessary, but there's no clear indication that such cuts are on the way. Without them, the company may struggle to turn its business around quickly.\"It doesn't help that many expect the Fed cavalry to show up on Friday when they head to Jackson Hole. If things don't go as expected, there could be a lot of selling, especially since it's a summer Friday.\"Our MethodologyIn this article, we analyzed a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money and selected ten stocks he talked about. We also included information on how hedge funds feel about each stock and ranked them based on the number of hedge funds that own them, from the fewest to the most.At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) the Number One EV Stock Across the Globe?A state-of-the-art electric vehicle charging at a station at a suburban mall.Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)Number of Hegde Fund Investors: 37When a viewer asked Jim Cramer about Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), he explained that the company has solid long-term potential due to its significant backing, which reduces the risk of running out of money in the short term. Cramer noted that, while Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) will face challenges in scaling up its operations, he is not focusing on short-term fluctuations.\"I think Rivian has a strong long-term potential because they have significant backing and therefore are unlikely to run out of money in the short term. However, it will be a rocky road as they have many challenges to overcome to ramp up their operations. I'm not going to focus on short-term movements, but for someone like you, Henry, who has a long-term horizon, this might be a good investment opportunity.\"Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is poised for significant growth, driven by its successful expansion of production facilities. Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) has increased its production capacity at its Normal, Illinois plant and is building a new facility in Georgia, which will add the ability to produce 250,000 vehicles annually by 2025. Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)'s strong order backlog, including a notable 100,000 electric delivery vans fromAmazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN), highlights substantial revenue potential and client confidence. Consumer demand is also robust, with over 90,000 pre-orders for the R1T and R1S models showing a positive market response.Strategic investments from Ford Motor Company(NYSE:F) and T. Rowe Price(NASDAQ:TROW), along with partnerships such as with Meridian Audio for premium sound systems, bring valuable capital and industry expertise. Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)'s ongoing research and development, including its advanced quad-motor system and the introduction of more affordable EV models, strengthens its competitive edge. Additionally, Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)'s commitment to sustainability through carbon-neutral manufacturing and the use of sustainable materials meets growing consumer and regulatory expectations.Meridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\"Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a US-based manufacturer of electric vehicles, namely the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV. They also have exposure to the commercial vehicle market with their electric delivery vans (EDVs) that are sold to companies like Amazon. The company has faced challenges amid the broader slowdown in electric vehicle demand and rising interest rates. This has contributed to Rivian underperforming expectations over the past few quarters. Rivian has also incurred losses as it continues to invest in the development of its products and manufacturing capabilities. We own Rivian in a hedged structure, which provides a significant margin of safety. Despite the near[1]term challenges, several factors provide optimism that Rivian can emerge as a long-term winner in the EV market. Rivian's balance sheet is strong, with a substantial cash position that enables the company to continue investing in its growth and navigate through the current economic headwinds. Rivian is also unveiling the R2, which is a smaller and more affordable EV platform that will open the company's products to a wider customer base. Lastly, Rivian's investment in the enhancement of its production capabilities should improve the company's manufacturing efficiency and drive a path to profitability. We continue to hold the company in a hedged structure.\"Overall RIVN ranks 9th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer wants you to check out. While we acknowledge the potential of RIVN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RIVN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. READ NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA 'Has Become A Wasteland'. Disclosure: None.

      "Russia's supply chain is bleeding, with Western sanctions to blame for one of Russia's largest forestry and paper companies urgently raising funds through the Moscow Stock Exchange— causing its share price to plunge more than 20% in a single day's trade.\n",
      "Yesterday, Segezha Group, Russia's largest pulp and paper producer, reported a 24% loss for the first half of 2024. It comes amid mounting losses, now at RUB 9.5 billion (or US $103 million), and total debt ballooning to RUB 144.2 billion (US $1.56 billion) by June 2024.\n",
      "\"Segezha's financial difficulties are largely driven by ongoing sanctions,\" according to Russian news wire services: \"The company has struggled since losing access to its key European market due to the European Union's embargo on Russian products, including plywood, lumber, and pellets, which took effect in July 2022.\"\n",
      "Wood Central has reported extensively on Russia's acute crisis – with high logistics costs, slowing Chinese demand, and increased competition from India, Brazil, and Argentina, forcing mills to cut production volumes.\n",
      "\"To counter this downturn, some mills have attempted to boost domestic sales by lowering pulp prices and shifting to manufacturing pulp in corrugated cardboard production instead of recycled paper,\" Wood Central revealed in July 2023, with Segezha redirecting huge volumes of kraft paper to the domestic market to cater to local needs.\n",
      "Segezha's current financial troubles come just three years after the (then) world's second-biggest producer of multiwall sack paper and industrial paper sacks pledged to list on the European Stock Exchange in either 2022 or 2023 before Russia invaded Ukrainian territory.\n",
      "The Moscow-listed Segezha, which has forestry assets in Russia and (had) paper packaging plants in Europe and Turkey, was targeting core annual earnings of 100 billion roubles ($1.4 billion) by 2025, up from 17.5 billion roubles last year, according to Rovshan Aliyev, the company's then vice-president for finance and investment.\n",
      "\"As we grow, we will consider a dual listing of our shares … We may return to this question by the end of 2022 or early 2023,\" Mr Aliyev told Reuters in September 2021, just months before the war. \"Most likely, this would be Europe, not the United States, given European companies account for the bulk of the pulp and paper industry.\"\n",

      "At the store, Monique Gonzalez's daughters chose matching pairs of Converse high-tops. They were beaming, eager to show their new sneakers to their friends at school.It had been a long time since Gonzalez, 41, had been able to afford new shoes for her children. The mother-of-six had been struggling to get by — bills were increasingly difficult to cover with her limited household income, which was a few thousand dollars a month between her and her fiancé. Seeing her daughters excitedly bring their Converse boxes up to the cash register was \"life-changing,\" she said.\n",

      "Gonzalez could afford that purchase because she was a participant in San Antonio's guaranteed basic income program. The pilot gave 1,000 low-income participants an initial $1,908 payment in December 2020, followed by eight quarterly payments of $400 between April 2021 and January 2023. Gonzalez was one of 25 participants chosen to receive an additional $500 a month for 18 months through December 2024.For Gonzalez's family, the pilot income meant being able to move from a motel to a rental home and more comfortably put food on the table. And, once her necessities were covered, she had a small amount of money left to buy her children something special: crayons and markers, Christmas gifts, and the new shoes. She said it made her feel \"worth something.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It absolutely makes you feel 100% better about yourself — seeing that you can provide for your kids' needs,\" Gonzalez previously told Business Insider. \"But when you can provide for a want every once in a while, it just puts it over the top.\"Like San Antonio's program, the overall GBI model offers participants recurring cash payments for a set period of time as an approach to poverty reduction. Participants typically receive between $50 and $2,000 a month, no strings attached, for one to five years. Over 100 pilots have been launched in cities across America, with many specifically focused on families.Gonzalez's experience echoes that of many other basic income participants: Cash payments not only provide a monthly financial boost but allow some parents to afford toys and activities for their children — small purchases, they say, that have big impacts on their family's quality of life.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You're deciding what's best for your family, you're the expert on your family,\" Gonzalez said. \"Being able to utilize these funds in a manner that puts you back into control: it boosts your confidence.\"The participants BI spoke with predominantly use their payments for essentials. An analysis of 30 pilot programs involving nearly 8,300 participants found more than half of their payments went toward groceries, transportation, housing, utilities, healthcare, and education. The analysis reflects participant transactions made with a bank account or a debit card, which amounted to about 60% of their total spending. The analysis didn't track how the participants spent cash.While some GBI pilots study changes in participants' happiness and mental health, those findings don't specifically include how the extra things people purchased for themselves or their loved ones made them feel. To analyze quality of life impact, experts often look at individual anecdotes and qualitative findings, instead of just quantitative spending data on bills.For some of the parents BI spoke with, guaranteed basic income meant affording stable day care and a stroller to go on neighborhood walks. Others told BI they used the cash to buy a new crib and onesies for their newborn.\n",

      "Melvin Carter, member of the advocacy network Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, said it can be difficult to fully capture the quality of life improvements in a dataset because the benefits differ widely between participants. Still, he said it's clear that cash aid has advantages.\"When parents have money to work with, children are better off,\" Carter, who is also the mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota, previously told BI.Basic income gave some families treats like dinners at restaurantsJeanette Fisher received $500 a month between summer 2022 and summer 2023 through Chicago's GBI program. She mainly used the money to pay bills and sign a lease on a new apartment for herself and her daughter.But the 46-year-old single mom said she used some of her first payment to take her daughter, Sophia, to dinner and entertainment at Chuck E. Cheese. They hadn't been since one of Sophia's childhood birthday parties — it meant a lot to Fisher that they could celebrate together. It's a memory they both treasure.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's been through a lot,\" Fisher previously told BI. \"And she's an amazing kid.\"Single moms in Birmingham, Alabama's Embrace Mothers basic income pilot had a similar experience. Aside from using their $375 a month to pay bills and afford childcare, many of the 110 mothers spent a portion of their money on toys, dance classes, or holiday gifts for their children.Monica, a Birmingham participant who used only her first name for privacy, spoke to researchers for the program's final report, which was published August 12. She said it's \"amazing\" when she sees her two-year-old daughter happy.\"At the point when I started receiving the money, I started doing the thing where I give her surprises,\" Monica told researchers. \"So come the 15th, I'd take her to the Dollar Tree. And I teach her numbers, so I'd say: 'Okay, mommy is going to allow you to have five items today. Let's see if you can count five.\"'\n",

      "To be sure, guaranteed basic income may not be a foolproof approach to poverty reduction. GBI programs are temporary, and it is not yet clear how cash payments impact participants in the months and years after the programs end. Some economists and politicians have said that GBI is too expensive for cities and philanthropists to finance over time.Not every family is going to spend guaranteed basic income in the same way, Carter said. But — whether parents are spending cash on meals, new shoes, or something else — he trusts that they are making the best decision for their family's happiness.\"What we're doing is betting on families, betting on families that are used to being bet against,\" Carter previously told BI. \"We're betting on families' ability to know how to manage their money.\"Have you benefited from a guaranteed basic income program?

      "\t\t\t\t\t\tEditorial cartoonist Scott Stantis for Wed, Aug 28, 2024, on the federal deficit and Donald Trump's and Kamala Harris' campaigns. (Scott Stantis/For the Chicago Tribune)\t\t\n",
      "\n",
      "By The Editorial Board | Chicago TribuneUPDATED: August 28, 2024 at 8:23 a.m.Donald Trump has proposed across-the-board tariffs on goods made abroad and sold in America, as well as substantial corporate tax cuts. Kamala Harris has proposed tax increases on corporations and the wealthy and a tougher federal response to what she deems \"price gouging\" by businesses.\n",
      "What neither candidate has done so far when it comes to the nation's economy is to address the actual challenges facing the federal government.\n",
      "Presidential campaigns tend to be overly broad on economic policy, all the better to give the winner maximum flexibility to act on taxing and spending once they take office. But in the past candidates generally have spoken to the actual issues at hand. At this point in the 2024 election, voters aren't even getting that much.\n",
      "The elephant in the room is that a substantial portion of the last major rewrite of the tax code, which Trump signed into law in 2017, will expire at the end of 2025. Most of the expiring provisions pertain to tax reductions for individuals. In order to enact as low of a corporate tax rate as possible (the GOP settled on 21%) while keeping within deficit financing limits, Trump and fellow Republicans in 2017 bet that Congress in 2025 would find it politically unpalatable to allow federal taxes on individuals to increase and would extend those cuts.\n",
      "That remains a good bet, but here's the difference between then and now. The federal budget deficit when the Trump tax cuts were enacted was $665 billion. This fiscal year it's approaching $2 trillion. The deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product in 2017 was 3.5%; this year it's set to be 7%.\n",
      "If the country were in a deep recession or still reeling from the effects of the COVID pandemic, such profligacy might be justifiable. It is plainly irresponsible now, and neither candidate even mentions the deficit, much less suggests how to reduce it.\n",
      "Both campaigns are doing the voters a major disservice in failing to realistically address the issue of the nation's fiscal woes and how they would handle the tax battle royale to come. The political adage, \"It's the economy, stupid,\" happens to be true. Polls show Americans are most concerned about the state of their pocketbooks; much of that angst has been trained on the aftereffects of the post-COVID inflationary period that substantially raised the prices of necessities like food, insurance and utilities.\n",
      "Both candidates have pledged to bring prices down. Trump has made those promises without saying how he'd do it. His promise to impose an across-the-board 10% tariff on imported goods is one of the more concrete of his economic policies, and most economists believe such protectionism would be highly inflationary. Trump's response is that the jobs created by giving American companies such a big boost would create economic growth that would more than make up for the costs. Our philosophical default there to back the free market. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Harris has offered a new clampdown on corporate \"price gouging,\" which has garnered brickbats even from some left-leaning pundits well aware of the history of price controls and the negative macroeconomic fallout they create.\n",
      "The truth is that consumers have done more to tame inflation than any government official ever could by changing buying habits. Companies selling name-brand everyday products now bemoan their lagging sales and are pivoting to appeal to cost-conscious consumers.\n",
      "So what should the federal government do to promote economic growth and stability? As is the case for households, it needs to get its fiscal house in order and set spending priorities. It's worth retracing how we got to a point where nearly a third — yes, you read that right — of what the feds will spend this year is being put on the national credit card.\n",
      "The aforementioned Trump tax law was deficit-financed from the start. This page at the time thought that was a good risk to take in order to jolt what had been a slow-growth economy into something more dynamic. Republicans said sustainable 3% annual growth in gross domestic product was the goal. The economy never got there before the pandemic upended our economic life, and we're not at that level today.\n",
      "One result that is undeniable, though, is that corporations have invested a large chunk of the tax windfall they're enjoying into repurchasing their own stock; for many, financial engineering appears a better use of excess cash than investing in growth initiatives that lead to higher employment. Stock buybacks are on course to set a record this year and to top $1 trillion in 2025, according to Goldman Sachs.\n",
      "The Democrats have had a strong hand in inflating the deficit as well. Massive federal spending, first to soften the blow of COVID on businesses and households and then to finance the Biden administration's debt-financed investments in infrastructure and green energy, significantly exacerbated the problem.\n",
      "No matter who wins the White House and which party controls Congress, there will be a sprawling tax bill next year, due to the overwhelming bipartisan desire to ensure there isn't a tax hike on the majority of Americans through mere inaction. Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who represents a broad swath of the Chicago suburbs, told us in an interview during the Democratic National Convention that he believes even the liberal wing of his party understands those $2 trillion deficits can't continue, even if few wanted to talk about that at the United Center.\n",
      "When the time comes, the job of coming to terms on a package that apportions the tax burden fairly while simultaneously reducing the deficit will be made significantly easier if the winning campaign comes to the table with something resembling a thumbs-up from voters on how to accomplish that. There's no way Trump or Harris will be able to do so if they don't even acknowledge the issue will be one of the first items on the next president's agenda and offer a broad-strokes idea of how to respond.\n",
      "Likewise, the lack of any mention of the deficit by either candidate is, while perhaps politically strategic, a disservice to the country. We daresay only a sliver of the taxpaying public understands they're financing close to a third of the federal budget with debt.\n",
      "The U.S. enjoys a special status as having the world's leading currency and being the pre-eminent safe haven for global investors. But red ink like we're seeing now isn't sustainable.\n",

      "HEALTHHospitality IndustryAdd TopicCEO got big bucks as his hospital chain imploded. Here's who suffered. Ken AlltuckerUSA TODAYDonna Gittens felt drained as she struggled to form words. Dinner plans with her husband and friends would have to wait. She worried she was in the middle of a stroke.Gittens was rushed to Carney Hospital, minutes from her home in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood. Last summer's emergency spanned two facilities as physicians unraveled a medical mystery. The underlying issue was a brain infection, but she credits her neighborhood hospital's doctors and nurses with saving her life.She now worries others in her area won't have access to the same emergency care.Carney is one of two Massachusetts hospitals targeted for closure Aug. 31 following recent chaotic developments at Steward Health Care. The embattled for-profit hospital chain filed for bankruptcy on May 6 and has been mired in crises involving patients and creditors across several states.The chain is led by a former heart surgeon who collected more than $100 million in compensation and bought a $40 million yacht while employees at Steward hospitals complained about a lack of basic supplies, according to a Senate committee. More than 2,200 employees now expect to be laid off in Massachusetts and Ohio, according to notices filed with state regulators.The company's CEO, who lawmakers say has declined multiple requests to answer questions voluntarily, is expected to appear under subpoena in mid-September before a Senate committee to address \"financial mismanagement\" at Steward.The case has raised broader issues for lawmakers and analysts about the role of private equity investments in health care. Many people from communities impacted by hospital closures are asking why there aren't built-in protections when a corporation takes over an institution providing essential life-or-death services.The problem extends beyond Massachusetts. State health regulators in Arizona this month suspended operations at a Steward-owned psychiatric hospital after the air conditioning at the Phoenix facility cut off amid triple-digit temperatures. In West Monroe, Louisiana, hospital workers described searching the premises for basic medical supplies during procedures. One patient died at the hospital awaiting transfer to another hospital, resulting in an \"immediate jeopardy\" citation from regulators, according to testimony at a Louisiana House Health and Welfare Committee meeting in April.After the chain declared bankruptcy, the Massachusetts governor enacted an emergency plan to manage the disposition of its seven remaining hospitals there. The company sought and received approval from the bankruptcy court to shutter Carney and a second facility, Nashoba Valley Medical Center in Ayer, by the end of August.Gittens, who survived a health scare, worries her local neighborhood with a diverse, mixed-income population, will be left without essential medical care. During medical emergencies like hers last summer, timely care can be the difference between life and death.\"Carney is integral not only to my family – but the broader community,\" said Gittens.Despite pleas from neighborhood leaders, the state has no plans to keep Carney or Nashoba Valley open. However, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said at an Aug. 16 news conference the state plans to use eminent domain to take control of another Steward hospital, St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Brighton. The state has struck deals with other operators to run the other four Steward hospitals.Healey blamed Steward's financial collapse on its CEO, Dr. Ralph de la Torre, and the hospital chain's executives.\"This is not something that Massachusetts created,\" Healey said. \"It was created by the greed and the exploitation of an individual, Ralph de la Torre, and members of his team. De la Torre's actions brought us to nearly the brink of collapse\" at Steward's hospitals.A spokesperson representing de la Torre did not respond to questions from USA TODAY about allegations of problems at an array of Steward Health Care facilities.In a statement, the company said it would seek to minimize disruptions to patients.\"This is a challenging and very unfortunate situation, and the effect it will have on our patients, our employees, and the communities we serve is regrettable,\" the statement provided by Steward representative Deborah Chiaravalloti said. \"SHC (Steward Health Care) is doing all we can to ensure a smooth transition for those affected, while continuing to provide quality care to the patients we serve.\"Lawmakers cite 'outrageous corporate greed'Steward Health Care was formed in 2010 when Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity firm, acquired a financially struggling nonprofit hospital chain from the Archdiocese of Boston. De la Torre, a Harvard Medical faculty member who previously led cardiac surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, became CEO of the new entity, named Steward Health Care.The Dallas-based company aggressively expanded to a chain of more than 30 hospitals employing more than 30,000 people. The expansion was fueled by a splashy deal engineered by de la Torre to sell the land underneath Steward's hospitals to a corporate landlord, Medical Properties Trust. The sale-leaseback deal left the hospitals with hefty rent payments. Bankruptcy filings show the company is now reeling with $9 billion in debt, including more than $6 billion in lease payments to its landlord.After the bankruptcy filing in May, Steward announced plans to close hospitals and lay off thousands of workers, leaving community members who depend on the hospitals worried about where they will get care.The chain's financial flameout captured the attention of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which authorized an investigation into the company's financial dealings. The Senate probe is expected to include questions about Steward Health's deal with private equity investors, its lavish spending, the lease deal and the hospital closures. The committee also issued a subpoena that compels de la Torre to answer questions about his company's struggles.At a July 25 hearing, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, who chairs the committee overseeing the investigation, said de la Torre refused multiple invitations to testify before lawmakers, which prompted the bipartisan vote to order him to testify on Sept. 12.While Steward closed its hospitals, Sanders said, de la Torre was collecting a \"$100 million payday that he used to purchase a $40 million yacht.\" Sanders said the executive also bought a $15 million, custom-made fishing boat and had access to two private jets.De la Torre \"epitomizes the type of outrageous corporate greed that is permeating throughout our for-profit health care system,\" Sanders said at the hearing. \"Today we are saying enough is enough. It is time for Dr. de la Torre to get off of his yacht and to explain to Congress the financial chicanery which made him extremely wealthy, while the hospitals he managed went bankrupt.\"When asked which sources Sanders relied on for his July testimony about de la Torre's compensation and boats, his staff provided links to articles in The American Prospect, The Boston Globe and Becker's Hospital Review.Beyond Capitol Hill, Steward is being scrutinized by other entities. The Justice Department launched a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud and corruption at the company, CBS and other outlets reported. The Justice Department and the U.S. Attorney in Boston declined to comment on whether the health care chain was under investigation.Steward also has been investigated in the Mediterranean nation of Malta, where the company reached a $4 billion euro deal to manage three hospitals. In May, a Maltese magistrate recommended criminal charges against de la Torre. That probe involved the former prime minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, who was charged with money laundering, corruption and bribery. He has pleaded not guilty and faces up to 18 years in prison, according to local media.Your wallet, explained. Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Money newsletter.Private equity in health care scrutinizedThe bankruptcy, hospital closings and disruptions to patient care at Steward are not the only issues the Senate committee will probe. Sanders plans to seek answers into private equity's growing stake in the health care sector.Sanders said at a July hearing private equity firms own 460 hospitals in the United States – or about 1 in 5 for-profit hospitals.\"How many of these hospitals are being loaded up with debt in order to make a handful of executives and private equity firms even wealthier?\" Sanders pondered aloud. \"How many of these hospitals are in danger of being shut down? How many patients are at risk?\"Experts say the Steward bankruptcy raises concerns about private equity's involvement in the health care industry. Under the Steward model, the company's debt became overwhelming as it acquired more hospitals and doctors' practices.The financial problems following Steward's acquisition spree were inevitable, said Dr. Vikas Saini, president of the Lown Institute, a Massachusetts-based health think tank.Saini blames the chaos on the lack of regulatory oversight for health care mergers and acquisitions.\"It illustrates how moth-eaten our oversight and regulatory apparatus is for the health care sector,\" Saini said. He added that hospital takeovers have \"much more social impact, much more meaning to communities than whether or not an iPhone plant gets built.\"Hospital ownership changes require more guardrails, transparency and public scrutiny, Saini said. \"We've got to be sure that you're not just selling us a bill of goods.\"Louisiana patients in 'immediate jeopardy'In Louisiana, state health regulators scrutinized Steward-owned Glenwood Regional Medical Center, which was hit with three \"immediate jeopardy\" warnings in 120 days from December 2023 through early 2024. These citations described lapses that put patients' safety in jeopardy and could result in the termination of Medicare and Medicaid payments.Debra Russell, a Glenwood nurse practitioner, worked at the hospital for more than three decades before she quit last November.During an April hearing before a Louisiana legislative committee, she described the dire circumstances for patients at the hospital. She recalled having to switch tactics in the middle of a procedure because the hospital didn't have a $5 tube called a guide wire. In another case, a young man came to the emergency room after a heart attack but staffers could not reach an on-call cardiologist because the specialist hadn't been paid. When staff tried to order medication from the pharmacy for the patient, the drug wasn't stocked because the hospital's supplier hadn't been paid.Evidence of the financial crunch also was visible outside the emergency room. Russell described coffee pots being repossessed and said document shredding companies had quit.Steward's days of operating that hospital appear to be nearing an end. Steward has announced another hospital operator, American Healthcare Systems, has bid to purchase Glenwood. The bankruptcy court must approve the deal.Steward declined to answer questions about the sale or operations at Glenwood. In a news release issued last May, the hospital said it addressed issues raised by state and federal regulators following the immediate jeopardy warnings.During the Senate hearing this spring, Russell, the former Louisiana staffer, recalled her final days at the Steward-owned hospital as particularly gutting to witness.\"It's the saddest thing I've ever been around,\" Russell said.Florida doctor sells to Steward; vendors don't get paidDr. Charles Fischman thought he had sufficiently vetted Steward Health Care after executives approached him about purchasing his Vero Beach, Florida, medical practice in early 2017. The internal medicine doctor was nearing retirement age and considering his next steps. He wanted to make sure his 10,000 patients, two fellow doctors, a nurse practitioner and administrative staff were in good hands.When Fischman met with Steward executives, he said each leader was more charming than the next. He felt comfortable with the idea of a physician-led company acquiring his practice. Steward representatives talked to his employees over breakfast and eased their worries.\"We felt good about it,\" Fischman said.But weeks after Steward took over on June 1, 2018, problems surfaced, he said. Longtime vendors, such as lab suppliers, complained they had not been paid. The local water and power companies were within 24 hours of shutting off services due to unpaid bills.Under the terms of the acquisition, Fischman signed a two-year contract to remain as a physician and a lab director. Things didn't improve in the following weeks and months, Fischman said.Fischman's wife, Carol, who also worked at the office, fielded complaints from vendors – people the Fischmans knew personally after 30 years in the community. They wanted to get reimbursed for their services so they could pay their mortgages and cover other basic living expenses, he said.At a Vero Beach dinner meeting with some Steward executives months after the hospital chain bought the medical practice, Carol asked why the vendors' payments were delinquent. She didn't get answers.\"All we heard were stories about fishing boats and hospitals in Malta,\" he said, recalling his conversations with Steward executives.His wife eventually quit in frustration. Fischman said executives pressured him to refer patients only to other Steward-employed physicians. He eventually left the practice in April 2020 and relocated to Tampa, where he still sees patients a few days a week.Chiaravalloti, of Steward, did not answer questions about the Vero Beach medical offices.Hospitals grapple with bankruptcy, closingsState health officials and medical community leaders from Massachusetts to Louisiana are now trying to assess how Steward Health Care's bankruptcy will affect day-to-day operations, as new information about the company's business dealings and practices continues to emerge.On Aug. 19, the Massachusetts governor's office sent a letter to Steward describing Carney Hospital as an \"essential service\" for Dorchester residents, while acknowledging the state lacks the \"power to mandate\" the hospital remain open.Some community leaders are urging the governor to keep the hospital open nonetheless.Bill Walczak, a former president of Carney, said the Dorchester hospital has been plagued by \"terrible decisions\" going back decades, long before Steward took ownership.But he said Carney is worth saving to ensure access for up to 250,000 people who live in its service territory. He described it as a health equity issue for residents. Offering such a remedy is within the state's purview, he said.\"Massachusetts is a very wealthy state, and it has a lot of power,\" Walczak said. \"If the legislature and governor and secretary of Health and Human Services wanted to put together a package today to preserve the essential services of the Carney Hospital, they could do it.\"Walczak noted the Healey administration vowed to use eminent domain to seize Steward's St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Brighton and transfer the facility to Boston Medical Center. The governor said Boston Medical Center's willingness to take over St. Elizabeth's was necessary to get the deal done. The hospital's landlord, however, vowed to fight the seizure. The company that owns the property rejected Gov. Healey's opening bid of $4.5 million to buy the location.Representatives of Healey and the state's Department of Public Health did not immediately answer questions about next steps in the hospital seizure.Dorchester leaders want the governor to orchestrate a similar deal to keep Carney open.\"This is not over,\" Walczak said. \"Perhaps the governor will understand there are a lot of lives that would be put in jeopardy by not having an emergency room and beds, at a minimum, in this section of the city.\"Ken Alltucker is on X at @kalltucker, contact him by email at alltuck@usatoday.com.Featured Weekly Ad\n"

    "p_text = 'A bipartisan group of senators is expressing concern over the USDA\\'s decision to use a single contractor to distribute food to Indian Reservations A bipartisan group of senators is demanding immediate action from USDA Secretary Thomas Vilsack after several tribal nations reported that a federal food distribution program they rely on has not fulfilled orders for months, and in some cases has delivered expired food. Last spring, the USDA consolidated from two contractors to one for deliveries of its Food Distribution Program in Indian Reservations. In a letter sent to Vilsack on Friday, the senators expressed concern that Native American families across the country are experiencing \"extreme disruptions.\" \"Participating households have not had consistent food deliveries for over four months,\" the senators wrote. \"This is unacceptable.\" The Associated Press obtained a copy of the letter exclusively Thursday, before it was sent the USDA leader. Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon said he was stunned to hear from five tribal nations in his state this summer that they have been struggling to meet their families\\' needs since the consolidation. \"The USDA must swiftly and fully address this self-inflicted crisis,\" Merkley said in a statement. \"There can be no more excuses for food delays, missed deliveries, or delivery of expired products.\" Merkley is joined in the letter by Republican senators John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer of North Dakota and Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, as well as Democrats Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Ron Wyden of Oregon, and Tina Smith of Minnesota.  More than 50,000 Native American families rely on this food, said Mary Greene-Trottier, who directs food distribution for the Spirit Lake Nation and is president of the National Association of Food Distribution Programs on Indian Reservations. \"They\\'re going without,\" Greene-Trottier said. \"Imagine showing up at the grocery store during Covid or a winter blizzard, and the shelves are empty. That\\'s the feeling that they get.\" Officials with Spirit Lake Nation, a tribe in North Dakota with about 7,600 members, said one order this month arrived only partially filled, and another the month before never came. \"We didn\\'t know our trucks weren\\'t coming until they didn\\'t show up,\" Greene-Trottier said. In a July letter to Secretary Vilsack, she and other tribal officials expressed skepticism that the remaining contractor, Paris Brothers Inc., would have enough time to transition into being the sole provider for food deliveries to dozens of tribal nations. The Kansas City, Missouri-based food wholesaler was given only four weeks to prepare for the increased workload, according to the letter. In a statement, Paris Brothers Inc. said it is \"actively addressing\" the recent challenges. The USDA has responded with updates in weekly calls with tribal leaders, and a consultation with tribes is scheduled for next month in Washington, D.C. The agency said the decision to consolidate was the outcome of a competitive bidding process, and Paris Brothers was the only company that the USDA board determined could meet the need. To help the contractor scale up to handle a larger influx of inventory, the agency has provided USDA staff to assist with customer service-related work with tribes and is partnering with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help with the company\\'s logistics program. \"Our first order of business has been to get food where it\\'s needed,\" the agency said in a statement. \"In addition, we are undertaking a review of our procurement process to prevent similar circumstances from occurring in the future.\" The agency also is assisting tribes in using other federal programs that can offer additional food and resources, and has offered $11 million to tribal nations to address the food shortages while Paris Brothers tries to catch up. But Greene-Trottier said that money likely won\\'t go far enough, and tribal leaders have been told they won\\'t be eligible for reimbursement of any additional costs. She\\'s been relying on other programs and scarce resources to fill the gaps. The Spirit Lake Nation and others have even offered to drive to Missouri to pick up their food orders themselves, but Greene-Trottier said that request was denied by the USDA. On Thursday, Spirit Lake Nation officials said they were told missing orders from July will be canceled and left unfulfilled. Vice Chair ReNa Lohnes said the tribe has yet to receive its portion of the $11 million, leaving them hard pressed for solutions and not knowing how, if ever, they will be made whole again. Lohnes said she had concerns from the beginning, when USDA announced the change, but she never imagined they would be where they are now. \"Thinking that we would be scrambling for food,\" she said. \"We\\'ve been told that it\\'s coming, it\\'s coming, it\\'s coming. And we wait and wait and nothing.\" —- This story has been corrected to Vilsack, not Vilsak. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events'\n",

    "p_text = 'Parents Are Going into Deeper Credit Card Debt to Cover Back-to-School Expenses Nearly one-third (31%) of U.S. adults doing back-to-school shopping this year will go into debt to pay for it or already have, according to Bankrate\\'s newest Back to School Survey. Also, this type of spending is up from 29% in 2022. Half of credit cardholders already have credit card debt, which is the highest percentage in 4.5 years, and that 6 in 10 credit card debtors have been in debt at least a year. Back-to-school costs, on average, for kids in kindergarten through 12th grade run about $875, according to The National Retail Federation. For the average college student, it\\'s about $1,365. [Fox Business] Consumers are running up their credit cards to cope with the high costs of everyday items Consumers Tap Credit Cards, Loans to Manage Inflation The share of U.S. adults who were using credit cards or loans to make ends meet amid rising prices rose to nearly 40% in October 2023, up from roughly 37% a year prior, according to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Also, about a third (34%) of adults who lived in a household experiencing a job loss used a credit card or a loan to handle price increases. Gen Z and millennials were the age groups most likely to use loans and credit cards to respond to higher prices. Besides relying more on credit cards, the Boston Fed said consumers were taking other measures to cut costs. Per its report, consumers have reduced their spending by eating less restaurant food, canceling subscriptions, purchasing less fresh produce and meat and switching to generic products. Survey respondents also reported contributing less to their savings, working more, moving to less expensive housing and delaying significant purchases. [Payments Dive] Retailers Are Making Millions from Cash-Back Fees, CFPB Says Three major retailers—Dollar General, Dollar Tree and Kroger—charge consumers more than $90 million annually via \"cash-back\" fees charged to access their own funds at a register, the CFPB said. While the cost to merchants for processing cash-back transactions \"may be a few pennies,\" fees passed on to consumers are often far higher. Among the examples highlighted were Dollar General and Dollar Tree, which charge $1 or more when customers withdraw less than $50 in cash. People living in rural communities or those without nearby bank branches commonly turn to retailers to get cash. Nearly 19 million people in the US were \"underbanked\" in 2021, according to the FDIC. The CFPB said cash is more often used by low-income consumers, racial minorities and older people. [Bloomberg] Fed Chair Sends Strong Signal Rate Cut is Coming in September The chairman of the Federal Reserve has all but officially announced a rate cut is coming in September. Speaking at the conclusion of the Kansas City Fed\\'s annual retreat here, Jay Powell made clear the Federal Reserve needs to make changes to its policy on rates, meaning lower them, in order to not weaken the job market further and to prepare the economy for a soft landing. [CU Today] Mastercard Brings Payment Passkey Service to India Mastercard chose India for the launch of its Payment Passkey Service. The online checkout security measure comes as India is dealing with a surge in fraud cases. Payment passkeys can help ease the problem by using device-based biometric authentication methods like fingerprints or facial scans to streamline online shopping. Mastercard\\'s service uses tokenization to secure a consumer\\'s payment details and biometric data, ensuring data is not shared with third parties and is of no use to scammers. [PYMNTS] ATM Fees Rise to $4.77, Hitting 26-Year High ATM fees have risen yet again in 2024, going up to $4.77 compared to $4.73 last year. This is the highest rate since 1998, according to a report by Bankrate. In addition, the average rate of overdraft fees has risen from $26.61 in 2023 to $27.08 in 2024, according to Bankrate. Overdraft fees peaked at $33.58 in 2021. However, many banks are removing or restricting overdraft fees, such as Citi removing them in 2022, Regions adding grace periods in 2023 and Discover introducing overdraft protection this year. [ATM Marketplace] Understanding 3D Credit Card Security and How It Could Affect Your Trips to Other Countries 3D Secure, or 3DS as it\\'s sometimes called, is a credit card security technology that helps verify the authenticity of online transactions. It checks several factors to authenticate a purchase, including the user\\'s location, the history of purchases on that card and whether the personal data provided during the transaction matches the bank\\'s records. If the technology identifies any abnormalities during this verification process, it may use additional security checks via text message, email or phone call before completing the purchase. The goal of 3DS is to provide better transaction authentication to help everyone involved: customers, banks and online merchants. Users benefit from an improved experience with a simpler transaction. Banks benefit from reduced fraud and chargebacks. Merchants benefit by providing an easier process so that consumers actually complete the transaction and spend money with the merchant.

That collaboration would integrate Zip\\'s installment payments offering with Apple in the U.S. The company also plans to announce pacts with major U.S. merchants during this quarter. Zip also recently announced that merchants using Stripe in the U.S. would be able to offer Zip to customers. Scott said the company is now seeking partnerships with other payments providers. Apple introduced a BNPL offering called Apple Pay Later in March of last year, but ceased offering new loans earlier this year, saying it planned to offer installment payment options for Apple Pay through other providers. [PYMNTS] Russia Challenges U.S. Dominance with New Cryptocurrency Exchanges Russia\\'s recent move to establish its own cryptocurrency exchanges is making waves in the financial world. George Tung, Host of CryptosRUs, explains that this decision, motivated by Russia\\'s leadership among sanctioned countries, reflects a broader strategy to distance itself from the U.S. dollar. This development could signify a shift in global financial dynamics, especially as other nations consider stockpiling bitcoin as part of their strategic reserves. Russia\\'s new exchanges will avoid any trading that involves the U.S. dollar, aligning with the nation\\'s push to operate independently of Western financial systems. [The Street]'\n",

    "p_text = 'Maybe you\\'ve heard of shrinkflation or lived it while opening a bag of chips. Well, it\\'s coming for your house, as Fortune has previously reported. Homes are shrinking in size and soaring in price. The median American home is 128 square feet smaller and $125,000 more expensive than it was five years ago, according to a recent analysis from service journalism group USA Today Homefront.\\xa0\\xa0 Its research team used Realtor.com data to examine changes in listing prices and square footage across 150 of the most populous metropolitan areas. Among those areas, only 18 have seen home sizes expand during the past five years. But without fail, each one saw prices rise. Basically, the median home is more than 6% smaller now, while the median price is 39% more expensive overall—and 52% more expensive per square foot.\\xa0 \"Metros with shrinking square footage continue to get more expensive per square foot,\" the analysis said. \"Essentially, building smaller houses isn\\'t stopping the growth in price per square foot, leaving buyers with a smaller house and an inflated mortgage.\"\\xa0 However, \"the phenomenon\\'s prevalence varies across metro areas,\" the analysis states—like everything in the housing world. Homes in Colorado Springs shrunk the most, by 21% since 2019, while listing prices rose 25%. Not to mention, seven of the 10 metros where homes contracted are in the South, four in North Carolina alone. On the other hand, in the Davenport metropolitan area, also known as Quad Cities, home sizes increased around 11%, and home prices leapt 58%. And in terms of price per square foot, it rose the most in the Naples metropolitan area, by almost 88%, potentially another sign of the bubble in Florida. So here\\'s what we know: Ultralow mortgage rates coupled with the ability to work from wherever, plus a need for space, fueled a housing boom throughout the pandemic. Home prices skyrocketed, and when it was over, because the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to lower hot inflation, mortgage rates soared. We were left with high home prices and high mortgage rates. Both have improved slightly: Mortgage rates are lower and home price inflation is slowing. Still, affordability is shot. And let\\'s not forget the cost of land and the cost to build have gone up too.\\xa0 About a year ago, Fortune reported that builders had no choice but to build smaller homes—it was their answer to deteriorated affordability. \"Builders have become increasingly aware of how bad affordability challenges are today, and that they need to do something to continue to be successful,\" Ali Wolf of home construction data firm Zonda explained at the time. \"And in this case, they\\'re trying to lower the overall home size to help lower the overall home price.\" Even before that, John Burns Research and Consulting\\'s Matt Saunders told Fortune: \"There\\'s really this active response by the builders to address these affordability concerns head-on, and one of the main kind of levers that they\\'re pulling is reducing home square footage.\" Still, both suggested homes weren\\'t actually becoming miniature versions of themselves. Instead, builders were looking for dead space to cut or making trade-offs within the homes. Let\\'s say they built more outdoor space rather than extra bedrooms. Even so, with smaller home sizes, prices have still gone up, but not as much as they would have if builders did nothing at all. Either way, it doesn\\'t seem likely to change anytime soon. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

    "p_text = 'High-powered tax attorneys bemoaned the 2010 legislation meant to crack down on big-dollar tax shelters. They ended up writing parts of an IRS directive that essentially undid it. In early 2010, U.S. lawmakers gave what was supposed to be a gift to IRS agents with the grueling job of ensuring the wealthiest people and largest corporations pay their fair share of taxes. Tucked inside President Barack Obama\\'s landmark Affordable Care Act was a new law that prohibited shifting money around for the sole purpose of avoiding taxes. This struck at the heart of the complex offshore tax maneuvers — the shell companies, sham trusts and dubious intercompany loans — that the affluent use to help keep billions of dollars from government coffers. Suddenly the notion that many of these schemes were technically legal was cast in doubt. Now it was up to the IRS to enforce the new law. In an era of government cuts and starved social services, this new law — known as the economic substance doctrine — was supposed to help U.S. tax authorities fight the estimated $688 billion a year in unpaid taxes. But then nothing happened. The IRS hardly touched its new weapon against high-end tax evasion — leaving billions of dollars on the table and its agents with little experience in using the law. But why? An investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists shows how, after coming under pressure from the industries that help wealthy people and corporations avoid taxes, the IRS\\'s Large Business and International Division, or LB&I, issued a directive that blocked agents from using the economic substance doctrine. \"The IRS had this institutional view not to raise it,\" Monte Jackel, a tax attorney who has served several stints as a high-ranking IRS lawyer, said of the economic substance doctrine. \"For a decade or so, it was a dead letter — invisible.\" ICIJ found that this IRS directive not only echoed some of the key requests of powerful tax industry players, it also copied several sentences directly from an industry lobbying letter that had urged restrictions on the new law, turning the exact words of tax attorneys for the wealthiest people into official IRS policy. Among those who prepared the lobbying letter were at least four tax attorneys at the corporate law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, where the IRS official who issued the directive had recently worked. That official, Heather Maloy, has since risen to top brass at the IRS, overseeing all of its enforcement divisions. A congressional committee estimated that the new tax law was supposed to raise billions in revenue, meaning that the directive may have quietly cost the government large sums. The reporting adds to growing evidence that LB&I, the office tasked with policing the wealthiest taxpayers, often takes a deferential approach to these powerful players. It also sheds light on the prevalence in the leadership of the IRS and the Treasury Department of tax lawyers who have recently represented the sorts of wealthy taxpayers LB&I is supposed to regulate. In response to ICIJ\\'s questions, the IRS emphasized that a recent inspector general report found that the agency did not give large multinational corporations preferential treatment. It also defended its handling of the economic substance doctrine and said that it values input from outside the government. \"A cornerstone element of fair and balanced tax administration is allowing those affected by IRS policies to have an opportunity to offer input,\" the agency said in an emailed statement to ICIJ. \"The tax system cannot operate in a vacuum, and we have a responsibility to give taxpayers the opportunity to be heard as we implement policy.\" ICIJ recently revealed that LB&I applies different and friendlier rules when auditing the wealthy as opposed to small businesses, and that its upper management shies away from even considering egregious tax-dodging cases for criminal referrals. The tiny number of such referrals from LB&I — no more than 22 in a recent span of five years — has frustrated some officials within the IRS\\'s Criminal Investigation Division, who say they\\'re often unsupported in identifying cases involving the biggest taxpayers. President Joe Biden\\'s administration vowed to tackle high-end tax evasion and secured a historic $80 billion from Congress in part to fulfill this pledge. Now, with this infusion of funding, LB&I is being put to the test. The agency recently made a dramatic reversal in how it regards the economic substance doctrine, touting it as a key tool to stand up to powerful tax cheats. The IRS now has to play catch-up with its deployment of the doctrine, after letting it gather dust since 2010. At stake are not only billions in government revenue, but also the fate of a key Biden campaign promise to stand up to some of the world\\'s wealthiest taxpayers. At least for the richest Americans, avoiding huge amounts of tax often comes down to paying well-heeled accountants and tax attorneys to create complex arrangements that exploit legal loopholes. Corporate tax advisers, though, fear the economic substance doctrine because it can cut through the artificial complexity at the center of many of these schemes. In the decades leading up to 2010, the economic substance doctrine lived informally in the court system. The government used the doctrine based on case law — i.e., the opinions of previous judges — to cobble together ad hoc and sometimes inconsistent ways of asserting it in tax cases. Lawmakers saw formalizing the doctrine in federal legislation as a crucial step to strengthen it as a deterrent to high-end tax evasion. The issue united Democrats and Republicans in the belief that the growing tax shelter industry posed a threat to the country\\'s governance. For a decade, a group of U.S. senators tried repeatedly to make the doctrine official law and consequently faced fierce opposition from the industry representing private tax advisers. In 2003, then-Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said that legislating the doctrine would help fight the \"systemic corruption that plagues the accounting, legal and financial communities in the pursuit of tax shelters.\" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, a two-time chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, declared in 2007 that it was the \"right policy.\" Although its enactment into law in 2010 was eclipsed in the news by the larger health-care reform bill, high-end tax advisers quickly took notice. In public pronouncements, the industry warned that the legislation had ushered in a new world where the codified economic substance doctrine could \"dramatically change the tax enforcement landscape.\" Just hours after the law passed, the corporate law giant Skadden, which has represented some of the country\\'s highest-profile tax evaders, warned that it \"will have an immediate effect on transactions in the planning stage\" and said \"taxpayers will need to proceed cautiously.\" The Big Four accounting firms — known to design highly complex structures of offshore shell companies for clients seeking to avoid taxes — also recoiled. Tax advisers should have difficult conversations with clients and take \"a back-to-basics, prudent course,\" warned an article in an industry publication co-authored by two tax accountants at accounting giant PwC. The Big Four firms began trying to shield themselves from the law\\'s impact, according to documents leaked to ICIJ as part of the Paradise and Pandora Papers. In an agreement to provide tax services to a hedge fund using an entity in the British Virgin Islands, PwC stated it would not be liable for \"penalties imposed on you if any portion of a transaction is determined to lack economic substance,\" citing the 2010 law. In another tax services contract for a major private equity firm using shell companies in the Cayman Islands, Deloitte said it assumed no \"responsibility for any penalties resulting from client\\'s failure to meet the requirements of the economic substance doctrine.\" Deloitte and PwC did not comment for this story. The law appeared to be changing the behavior of some of the largest firms. But would this last? Back in the U.S., the powerful tax law firms that work closely with the Big Four pressed the IRS to restrain its new powers. On Jan. 18, 2011, a group of eminent corporate tax lawyers sent a 66-page letter to then-LB&I Commissioner Maloy and other IRS executives. It urged the IRS to place extensive restrictions on the law that would, in practice, widely obstruct agents\\' ability to use it. The letter called the law\\'s civil fines \"a significant stick\" and urged the IRS \"to be measured in how it swings this stick.\" This letter was written and reviewed by various prominent lawyers, including at least four tax attorneys at Skadden, the firm where Maloy had recently worked as a tax attorney. Two of those were partners at Skadden. It didn\\'t take long for the private sector to get what it wanted from LB&I. On July 15, 2011, Maloy issued a directive that required agents take a series of steps and analyze more than two dozen factors before even asking for approval from a high-ranking IRS executive to use the new law. Agents had to notify the taxpayer as soon as they even considered asking for approval to pursue the economic substance doctrine, and then an IRS executive had to offer the taxpayer a chance to explain their position before the agent could receive approval to use the doctrine. The directive narrowed the scope of penalties agents could seek and defined how agents were generally supposed to analyze transactions — provisions sought by industry. By placing procedural hurdles in the way of using the doctrine, the directive effectively torpedoed a tax law that legislators had fought for a decade to pass. In addition to fulfilling key requests of industry players, the directive copied three sentences directly from the 66-page lobbying letter into official government policy. High-end tax attorneys celebrated the directive. A news bulletin on one tax law firm\\'s website trumpeted: \"LB&I directive softens economic substance doctrine.\" Another firm declared that the steps imposed on agents will likely place \"a damper on the number\" of cases in which the doctrine could be used. Industry players themselves \"could not have written a more favorable set of audit guidelines than those in the new LB&I Directive,\" observed Jasper Cummings, a tax attorney with the law firm Alston & Bird LLP who co-authored the 66-page lobbying letter, in a memo posted to the firm\\'s website. \"As a result of the Directive recently issued,\" Cummings added, \"the Economic Substance Doctrine will begin to share a key attribute of Santa Claus: to be more talked about than seen.\" In a memo posted to its website, Skadden described the directive as fulfilling hopes of the industry and said it provided a \"welcome assurance\" that the new law \"will not be asserted without considered review.\" Counsel said the approval process was too burdensome, so they didn\\'t want to pursue it … They made it administratively impossible to use. One industry contributor to the 66-page lobbying letter said in a 2018 academic article that as a result of the Maloy directive, the \"economic substance doctrine arguably loses any deterrent effect … because taxpayers know that the IRS is unlikely to raise the economic substance issue.\" An LB&I agent who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the press said he worked on an audit several years ago in which a wealthy individual had dodged millions in taxes through a series of maneuvers that the agent believed could be challenged under the economic substance doctrine. But, the agent said, the July 2011 directive stopped him from using it, partly because of hesitance from the IRS attorneys he worked with. \"Counsel said the approval process was too burdensome, so they didn\\'t want to pursue it,\" the agent told ICIJ. After this instance, the agent said that he did not try to use the doctrine again: \"They made it administratively impossible to use.\" For years, watchdogs and lawmakers have expressed concern about the potentially corrupting effects of individuals from the private tax industry ending up in high ranks of the IRS and its parent agency, the Treasury Department. Prominent tax attorneys from Big Four accounting firms or corporate law firms sometimes help implement favorable policies for their former clients. These officials often rejoin the private firms with rapid promotions. Earlier this year, ICIJ reporting showed that top executives in LB&I commonly switch hats from regulating the wealthiest taxpayers to working for them. A review of LB&I executive lists from the past 13 years shows that out of 114 top executives named, at least a quarter either had worked for a major accounting firm, a tax consulting firm or a major tax law firm shortly before joining the IRS, or left the IRS for such private sector roles. The IRS\\'s watchdog, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), warned last year that the movement of employees between the IRS and accounting firms and big companies raised \"impartiality concerns.\" As the IRS embarks on a major hiring spree with its new billions, the questions around guarding against industry influence have gained new urgency. \"People from the private sector provide important viewpoints and unique expertise needed to help the IRS run the tax system,\" IRS spokesperson Robyn Walker told ICIJ in a statement for a previous story. \"This takes on even more importance as the agency works to build compliance work in high-risk corporate and high-wealth areas.\" The agency also told ICIJ that safeguards are in place to prevent conflicts of interest. These rules forbid officials from working on matters too closely related to their work for a former employer in the private sector. Yet these safeguards generally rely on these officials to proactively identify and declare such conflicts to the agency. In January 2022, TIGTA received an eight-page complaint from an agent alleging that Maloy\\'s directive had been influenced by the private sector. The complaint alleged that \"we at the IRS are not enforcing our tax laws on multinational taxpayers using tax structures lacking economic substance.\" The complaint emphasized that the 66-page letter urging LB&I to restrict the new law was co-authored by attorneys at Skadden, Maloy\\'s former employer, and alleged that the government was not enforcing its own rules around conflicts of interest. \"There\\'s clearly a revolving door influence in play within the IRS,\" the complaint stated. \"Private sector attorneys from numerous firms known to be involved in promoting, opining, and defending abusive tax structures seized the opportunity to use revolving door colleagues in the executive ranks of the IRS to request, influence and craft guidance,\" the complaint also said. The complaint urged the inspector general to assist the IRS in reviewing and revoking the directive. One of the world\\'s largest corporate law firms, Skadden has a tax practice that employs a former IRS commissioner and a former executive of LB&I. One of the authors of the 66-page letter, Brendan O\\'Dell, left Skadden in 2016 to spend six years in high-ranking positions within LB&I and Treasury before becoming the director of tax controversy for Amazon. Another of the letter\\'s authors, Cary Douglas Pugh, left Skadden in 2014 to become a judge in federal tax court in Washington, D.C., making her among the most powerful people in tax law. The IRS agent\\'s complaint to TIGTA has not been previously reported. Michael Welu, a former IRS agent who has been outspoken on the issues he saw within LB&I during his more than three decades at the IRS, provided a copy of the complaint to ICIJ. The complaint\\'s author, Brian Visalli, is a special agent in the Criminal Investigation Division. \"While I\\'ll confirm I\\'m a government whistleblower, I will not confirm or deny any specific complaints or documents I\\'ve provided to TIGTA,\" Visalli told ICIJ in a LinkedIn message. Visalli added that, due to concerns over retaliation, he would not comment further. In 2015, after almost six years of running LB&I, Maloy left the IRS to become the US Tax Controversy Leader at the Big Four accounting firm EY. EY\\'s website from that time lists Maloy as a contact in relation to its services around a highly technical practice known as \"transfer pricing\" that is at the heart of some of the largest tax avoidance schemes. After five years at EY, Maloy returned to the IRS as a top executive in charge of the entire agency\\'s compliance efforts. The heads of LB&I, Criminal Investigation and other major compliance divisions now report to her. ICIJ found that Maloy was not the only government official receiving policy requests from former private-sector colleagues related to the 2010 law. In January 2011, Lisa Zarlenga, then a tax partner at Steptoe & Johnson LLP — a corporate law firm that had opposed to the new law — was named as an author on the 66-page letter requesting restrictions on the IRS\\'s use of the doctrine. Two of Zarlenga\\'s colleagues at Steptoe, Mark Silverman and Amanda Varma, were also co-authors of the letter. But a similar letter co-authored by Silverman and Varma and sent just 3½ months later listed Zarlenga as a recipient. This was because Zarlenga had switched hats to become a high-ranking tax policy official at Treasury. In an interview with ICIJ, Zarlenga said she had nothing to do with Maloy\\'s directive. \"Treasury would have had no involvement in that directive. I saw it when it was published in Tax Notes along with everyone else.\" In an interview after the the 2011 directive, Silverman — who had helped lead Steptoe\\'s opposition to the doctrine — called the directive \\'thoughtful\\' and \"extremely well done.\" Zarlenga, who now heads Steptoe\\'s Tax Policy Practice, said that it\\'s both common and important for the industry to weigh in on what the IRS is working on. \"Government officials interact pretty regularly with practitioners,\" she said. \"It\\'s all part of the flow of information. Otherwise, the government attorneys are sort of sitting in an ivory tower and they don\\'t know what is going on.\" Several months after TIGTA received the complaint in 2022, the IRS quietly rolled back the LB&I directive at issue, replacing it with a set of rules that stripped away a number of restrictions on agents\\' use of the economic substance doctrine. This was more than a decade after Congress passed the doctrine into law. The IRS did not respond to requests to comment on this story or answer questions about why it changed its rules around the doctrine in 2022. Suddenly the industry that had once applauded the directive sounded the alarm once more. In the wake of the new guidance, EY told its clients that \"taxpayers should focus on penalty protection\" and should consult tax professionals \"before entering into transactions with related parties\" — a technical term that generally means shifting assets or liabilities between entities all owned by a single person or business. In a post on its website, corporate law giant Baker McKenzie said the updated directive exemplifies what it called \"the IRS\\'s increasingly offensive posture.\" The law firm was right. In August 2022, Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which included the $80 billion for the IRS to help fulfill his promise to make the wealthiest people and corporations pay their fair share of taxes. Despite its languid existence after being passed, the 2010 law has become a critical part of this effort. In June, the IRS announced an initiative to tackle tax abuse in the highly complex realm of investment partnerships, which have become a key means for the richest people on Earth to increase their wealth while minimizing the U.S. government\\'s slice of the pie. In announcing the move, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen raised eyebrows by stating that \"many of these transactions violate the codified economic substance doctrine\" — a clear shot at the tax planners serving the ultrawealthy. Following through on this tougher rhetoric may be difficult, though. Recent ICIJ reporting showed that LB&I often takes an accommodating approach toward the largest taxpayers. Over the past five years, the division flagged no more than 22 instances of possible tax crimes for criminal investigators to review further — out of trillions of dollars in annual income from large corporations and ultrawealthy people that the office oversees. The IRS office that covers small businesses and self-employed people flagged roughly 40 times more possible crimes. In the agency\\'s own comments to ICIJ for earlier stories, the IRS suggested that large corporations break the law less often than other types of businesses, saying their checks and balances and their use of independent accountants \"generally limit the opportunity for criminal activity.\" ICIJ found that the agency treats these powerful taxpayers accordingly. On Wednesday, TIGTA released an extensive report on the IRS\\'s challenges to stand up to tax evasion by multinational corporations and addressed frustrations of agents around the difficulty of using the economic substance doctrine. The report also said that the IRS\\'s 2022 change to the directive was \"a result of gaining experience and a level of comfort in the application of the doctrine.\" It added that \"the IRS could not provide us with the number of cases where examination teams considered the Economic Substance Doctrine.\" The report, which was premised on determining whether the IRS gives multinational corporations preferential treatment, said it found no instances of such treatment. It did, however, recommend that LB&I review its procedures around enforcement of multinational taxpayers, including around its use of the economic substance doctrine. Experts say that the decade when the doctrine lay dormant may put the office at a disadvantage for a number of reasons. One is that the IRS\\'s agents and attorneys have little experience using it and could be forced into a trial-and-error approach. Some commentators say that, despite all of the commotion around the law, it may be vulnerable to legal challenges. The previous dearth of cases involving the new law also means that judges are just now getting the chance to issue significant rulings on it. The way judges interpret any tax law sends important signals to the IRS about how to pursue winning legal arguments in court — where they face tax attorneys for large corporations and the ultrawealthy known to spend massively to defeat the IRS. \"They haven\\'t had a lot of experience in actually applying it in real-world cases or seriously thinking about it,\" Jackel, the tax attorney, said of the 2010 law. \"It will be a slow process for them to get up to speed on it and be confident in their ability to assert the doctrine.\" Some of the IRS\\'s cases using the 2010 law are beginning to make their way through the courts. Most significant of these is the agency\\'s attempt to invalidate a $2.4 billion tax deduction claimed by Liberty Global, the multinational telecommunications firm led by billionaire John C. Malone. With a net worth of roughly $9.8 billion, Malone is the largest voting shareholder in Liberty Global and is listed by Bloomberg as the second largest private landowner in the U.S., holding some 2 million acres across the country. In 2020, Liberty Global asked the IRS for a $110 million refund for overpaying its 2018 taxes. The massive refund request was based on a complex series of maneuvers — involving shuffling assets between subsidiaries in places like Belgium, the Netherlands and Slovakia — that had been created by Liberty Global\\'s tax department with help from Deloitte. In challenging the refund request, Justice Department lawyers alleged that the entire point of the transactions was to improperly exploit a new loophole in federal tax law. Liberty Global\\'s tactics did not emerge out of thin air. In one filing, the Justice Department noted that the \"situation arises because tax litigators have been developing strategies\" like Liberty Global\\'s. In emails contained in court records, Liberty Global\\'s tax department discussed paying Deloitte and another Big Four firm, KPMG, hundreds of thousands of dollars for their work on the complex international tax structures. The Justice Department attorneys noted that Skadden had publicly endorsed a refund tactic similar to that of Liberty Global. Skadden did not respond to a request for comment. In October 2023, the IRS won its case against Liberty Global, with a federal judge in Colorado ruling that the company\\'s use of a loophole was not permitted under the 2010 law. That ruling was \"the worst nightmare for tax planners who rely on \\'catching\\' Congress in a glitch in the law,\" wrote Jasper Cummings, the tax attorney at Alston & Bird. \"This Liberty Global opinion is by far the scariest [economic substance doctrine] opinion of recent times and shows a Justice Department unleashed from the historic norms of the income tax.\" Liberty Global maintains that its tax reporting in connection with the case was correct. Although Liberty Global had acknowledged that the maneuvers did not have any true business purpose apart from avoiding taxes, according to court documents, it appealed the ruling in April on technical grounds around applying the doctrine. The firm\\'s lawyers said \"the court fundamentally misunderstood\" the case and asserted that the IRS \"wrongly wields the economic substance doctrine to rewrite, rather than interpret, the law.\" If Liberty Global prevails in its appeal, it could create a precedent, perhaps as high as with the U.S. Supreme Court, that would weaken the IRS\\'s use of the doctrine moving forward.

    "https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/price-gouging-is-real-and-we-should-do-something-about-it\n",
    "p_text = '\\nA Magazine of Politics and Culture\\n The Harris campaign has been criticized for proposing price controls on groceries, but that\\'s actually not a bad idea at all.  In a campaign speech earlier this month, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris laid out several new planks of her economic agenda. Among them were expansions to the child tax credit, subsidies for homebuyers, and caps on prescription drug costs. But the policy that seems to have the most people talking is Harris\\'s proposal for the \"first-ever federal ban\" on price gouging for food and groceries.  According to Forbes, grocery prices have increased 27 percent since July 2019. And while inflation has cooled back to roughly pre-pandemic levels, American families are still feeling the pinch, spending the greatest percentage of their household budgets on food in three decades, according to the Department of Agriculture. If you shop for groceries, you\\'ve surely seen it: A carton of grade-A eggs that cost $1.40 five years ago now costs more than $3 on average. A gallon of milk that cost just under $3 now costs nearly $4. And a pound of beef that cost less than $4 now costs around $5.50.  Polls show that inflation is still the number-one issue voters are worried about, and Harris is attempting to address that concern. While the major spikes in inflation that took place over the first two years of the Biden administration were multifaceted, with supply-chain hiccups, the war in Ukraine, and increased demand from a strong labor market all playing a role, Harris is making the case that price gouging by large corporations was also to blame. \"Many big grocery chains that have seen production costs level off have nevertheless kept prices high,\" says a fact sheet from her campaign. To deal with this problem, Harris says she plans to \"set clear rules of the road to make clear that big corporations can\\'t unfairly exploit consumers to run up excessive profits on food and groceries\" and \"secure new authority for the [Federal Trade Commission] and state attorneys general to investigate and impose strict new penalties on companies that break the rules.\"\\xa0  Harris\\'s rollout of this policy has been widely panned in the press. The libertarian magazine Reason called it \"dishonest and stupid,\" which is unsurprising coming from them, but even more mainstream publications haven\\'t been much kinder, with the Atlantic\\'s Josh Barro calling Harris\\'s plan \"economically dumb\" and saying her \"promises make no sense to people acquainted with supply and demand.\" Positive write-ups, like Nick Hanauer\\'s in the New Republic, have been the exception rather than the rule. The skepticism is not entirely unwarranted. For the moment, Harris\\'s policy is frustratingly vague. Nowhere has she defined the term \"price-gouging,\" nor has she given any parameters for what constitutes \"excessive profits,\" which makes it hard to give her particular ideas for tackling the problem a critical evaluation. Additionally, 37 U.S. states already have some form of price gouging law on the books. Harris needs to clarify what exactly her proposal would do that these laws have failed to do.\\xa0  But a lot of commentators have taken issue not with the policy\\'s lack of detail, but with its very premise. As you\\'d expect, conservatives including Donald Trump are running with the line that proposing price controls proves Harris is a \"communist.\" (A line that only makes sense, Newsweek points out, if you are also willing to call Richard Nixon a communist.) Allison Schrager of the right-wing Manhattan Institute has stated that Harris was reviving the \"price-gouging myth\" and that her policy was \"the wrong solution to a nonexistent problem.\" Even liberal publications have taken a similarly derisive tone. In an August 15 editorial, the Washington Post\\'s Catherine Rampell suggested that conservatives had a point when calling Harris\\'s plan \"communist,\" and said that the Vice President was \"exploiting [inflation] for demagogic gain because push-polling suggests people are mad about \\'greed.\\'\" In USA Today, Nicole Russell wrote that \"No one with a half-way functioning brain thinks that inflation, which caused high prices, at the local grocer is due to price gouging by corporations.\" CNN\\'s news article on the policy, which carries the rather opinionated headline that \"Harris\\' plan to stop price gouging could create more problems than it solves\" is a touch more charitable, saying that \"many economists contend corporate profits were juiced by that thing you learned in Econ 101: supply and demand—not corporate greed (alone, anyway).\" It would be one thing if these articles simply argued that Harris\\'s proposed method to combat price gouging was faulty or ill-considered. I don\\'t think the contours of the policy are clear enough yet to make that judgment, but these writers are certainly free to give their predictions. But the writers don\\'t just argue that Harris is wrong about how to fight price gouging. They seem to think that the mere idea of price gouging is laughable, something that nobody with even a basic degree of economic literacy could believe is a real problem. \\xa0  \\xa0 Except that\\'s obviously not true. We know that companies have dramatically increased their profits on the backs of consumers in the last few years. Pointing to an increase in corporate profits from 9.7 percent of America\\'s total GDP in 2020 to 11.2 percent in 2023, Hanauer estimates that companies \"have gouged their way to an almost unbelievable $1.5 trillion in excess profits since 2020—that\\'s in addition to their pre-pandemic profit rates.\" This means that price gouging has cost American families $12,000 on average in that time frame. Food manufacturers have attempted to justify increasing prices by pointing to the increased costs of labor and materials, as well as supply chain hiccups that created shortages. If companies were only raising their prices to accommodate rising input costs, this would make sense. But grocery stores and manufacturers have both been bringing in considerably bigger profits than they did before the pandemic.\\xa0 Some of the price increases have come from profits at the retail level. According to a report from the Federal Trade Commission, food and beverage retailers increased their revenues from 5.6 percent above their total cost in 2015 to more than 6 percent in 2021 and 7 percent in 2023. And according to Forbes, \"The top 10 retailers increased their combined profits by over $10 billion [in 2021 and 2022] and issued over $15 billion in shareholder buybacks.\" And on Tuesday, a Kroger pricing executive, Andy Groff,\\xa0even admitted during questioning at an FTC hearing that the company\\'s objective was to \"pass through our inflation to consumers\" and that \"on milk and eggs, retail inflation has been significantly higher than cost inflation.\" Meanwhile, a lot of gouging happened at the manufacturer level too. Reporting from April 2023 by Nik Popli, in Time magazine, provides several examples of major companies that saw historic windfalls in the pandemic\\'s aftermath:\\xa0 \\xa0 At Kraft-Heinz, the multinational food company that makes Oscar Mayer, Jell-O, and Kool Aid, profits for the quarter ending at the end of 2022 were up nearly 450%, compared to the prior year, at $887 million. Tyson Foods, the largest meat company in the U.S., more than doubled its profits between the first quarters of 2021 and 2022. And General Mills, which owns Kix, Trix, and Chex among other recognizable cereal labels, saw its fourth quarter profits last year rise 97% compared to the previous quarter.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Even four years after the initial shock of the pandemic, many companies that raised their prices have not brought them back down. For example, even as input costs dropped in 2023, PepsiCo announced that they would not bring their prices back down to accommodate it. In fact, they did the opposite, increasing prices by double digits in 2023 and 2024. The Groundwork Collaborative, a group of progressive economists, has found this to be true across the economy as a whole. \"Corporate profit margins,\" they wrote in a study published in January, \"have remained high and even grown—as labor costs have stabilized, nonlabor input costs have come down, and supply chain snarls have eased.\" Looking at inflation from April to September 2023, they found that corporate profits accounted for 53 percent of the increase in consumer prices, compared with just 11 percent forty years before the pandemic.\\xa0 Another study, from the U.K.-based think tanks Common Wealth and the Institute for Public Policy Research, looked at the financial statements of companies from the U.S., U.K., European Union, Brazil, and South Africa. It determined that across the period from 2019 to 2022, the U.S. experienced 9 percent inflation while the Eurozone experienced 11 percent. But at the same time, corporate profits increased by anywhere from 32 to 44 percent depending on the country. Fortune magazine described this pattern as evidence that companies were \"lying to you about inflation.\" It\\'s not just lefty think tanks reaching these conclusions. The International Monetary Fund (not exactly a cabal of hardened communists) looked at inflation across the Eurozone in 2022 and found that 45 percent of it could be attributed to \"domestic profits.\" The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City reached a similar conclusion about inflation in the U.S., stating that \"markup growth,\" that is, the increase in the ratio of how much a firm charges vs. production costs, \"was a major contributor to inflation in 2021.\" This and other economic analyses demonstrating such astonishing profiteering even surprised some in the belly of the beast. Albert Edwards, a strategist at one of Europe\\'s oldest investment banks, Société Générale, said the following in April 2023: \\xa0 After working in finance for over 40 years I had felt there wasn\\'t much that could surprise me. Yet I find the unprecedented levels of corporate Greedflation in this economic cycle astonishing. The latest release of US whole economy profits data delivered another shock to my weakening confidence that the capitalist system is working as it should. \\xa0   Another criticism of Harris\\'s crusade against \"price gouging\" is the idea that grocery prices are no longer a problem because the rate of inflation has settled back to normal levels. While this is true that inflation has cooled, it\\'s not actually helpful in terms of high food prices. Inflation is the rate of increase, so when grocery costs rise dramatically for years and then stop, it might technically be true that \"inflation has gone down\"—but we\\'re still stuck with the price increases from the past years, and Americans are still paying a greater percentage of their incomes for groceries than they were five years ago. And this doesn\\'t even begin to address the fact that the costs of other major expenses like housing, energy, medical care, and transportation have also grown considerably. An Urban Institute study from 2023 found that in order to pay for groceries, families were increasingly going into credit card debt, relying on apps like Buy Now, Pay Later, or even taking out predatory payday loans.  To be clear, groceries are just one of many areas where the government should intervene to make life more affordable, and addressing price gouging on food should not come at the expense of addressing it in other areas of life. (To her credit, Harris has proposed policies of varying quality and specificity to address childcare, housing, and prescription drug costs too. In Jacobin, Matt Bruenig has a useful article breaking each of them down.)  It\\'s clear, however, that food manufacturers and retailers got away with screwing us badly over the past few years. The New York Times reported earlier this year that a lot of companies have been \"testing the limits\" of how much they could charge consumers, and found there were fewer than they once thought:\\xa0 \\xa0 Big companies that had previously pushed through one standard price increase per year are now raising prices more frequently. Retailers increasingly use digital price displays, which they can change with the touch of a button. Across the economy, executives trying to maximize profits are effectively running tests to see what prices consumers will bear before they stop buying.   Huge disruptions to supply chains pushed up corporate costs during the pandemic and forced many companies to think more creatively about their pricing strategies, [Alexander MacKay, coleads the Pricing Lab at Harvard Business] said. That supercharged a trend toward more rigorous pricing, and showed many companies that they could more boldly play with prices without chasing shoppers away. The experimentation continues even as costs ease. \\xa0 Stores like Walmart and Kroger, meanwhile, are increasingly exploring the possibilities of so-called \"dynamic pricing,\" a practice similar to the \"surge pricing\" that makes Uber and Lyft rides cost more at peak hours. As a letter from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bob Casey warns, digital price labels may soon be used to \"rais[e] prices suddenly and at times when certain products are in highest demand,\" such as \"the price of turkeys in the days leading up to Thanksgiving, or the price of ice cream on a hot day.\"  Inflation may have come back to normal—more or less—but it\\'s only a matter of time before the next economic crisis comes around. We need to have guardrails in place to make sure that companies can\\'t take advantage. So what can be done?    After getting flogged in the press, the Harris campaign has attempted to reject any notion that they are proposing sweeping, industry-wide \"price controls.\" The campaign has suggested, in characteristically vague terms, that Harris\\'s policy would more closely mirror already existing state laws that prevent jacking up the prices of certain goods in cases of emergency—\"the sort of laws that prevent stores from quadrupling the price of snow shovels right after a blizzard hits,\" as the New York Times says.  It\\'s hard to know whether Harris and her team are backtracking, or if the campaign left the policy intentionally vague to test the response. But regardless, it\\'s a shame to see them so responsive to media backlash and obvious bad-faith attacks from Republicans, who will call them communists no matter what they propose.\\xa0 It\\'s also a shame that Democrats are so quick to summarily dismiss the idea of broader price controls. This is a needless concession to the orthodoxy of \"Economics 101,\" which is usually more conventional wisdom than actual fact. Indeed, many of the arguments I have seen thrashing Harris at the mere suggestion that she may impose \"price controls\" rely heavily on their theoretical shortcomings in a utopian market dreamscape rather than how they\\'ve actually played out in reality. Let\\'s take Rampell\\'s argument in the Washington Post. She suggests that Harris would likely model a piece of price gouging legislation off a bill introduced by Elizabeth Warren in 2020 (a fair assumption at the time, since Harris had not yet backed off the idea of wide-reaching price controls). Rampell writes:\\xa0 \\xa0 It\\'s hard to exaggerate how bad this policy is. It is, in all but name, a sweeping set of government-enforced price controls across every industry, not only food. Supply and demand would no longer determine prices or profit levels. Far-off Washington bureaucrats would. The FTC would be able to tell, say, a Kroger in Ohio the acceptable price it can charge for milk. \\xa0 \\xa0 There are a few obvious red flags here. For one thing, there\\'s the simplistic dichotomy of good, natural, virtuous \"supply and demand\" being subverted by the big, scary \"far-off Washington bureaucrats\" who seek to \"control prices.\" Really, all prices are the result of choices from someone. The only question is who. A Kroger pricing manager\\'s only incentive is to maximize the company\\'s profits by charging as much as they believe they can get away with. At least a \"far-off Washington bureaucrat\" would face some mechanism of democratic accountability.  Rampell also brings up the dangers of shortages, which is another common argument against price controls. The theory goes that by limiting the price a producer can charge, you limit their incentive to produce. We\\'ve seen instances of this before: Rampell links to a story from Argentina in 2007, where retailers could not find cattle farmers who were willing to sell beef to them at government prices. If you go back further, to World War II, you can find stories of meat producers packing sausages with \"soybeans, potatoes, or cracker meal\" and selling muskrat steaks to save money due to the government suppression of meat prices.    For the era of greedflation, a possible alternative solution to capping prices would be to instead cap profits. As historian Uwe Fuhrmann writes, this is something that West Germany did to curb inflation after World War II: \"the authorities established legally binding \\'maximum prices for end consumers\\' and capped profit margins at 20 percent. Only after this combination of price controls and revenue caps did prices finally go down…\"   But there are also plenty of modern examples of price controls being used successfully in the United States. Rent controls are some of the best examples, as catalogued by Mark Paul last year in the American Prospect: \\xa0 One study of rent control in New Jersey—a state with a rich history of embracing rent control—found that, over three decades, rent control increased housing supply (though this was largely attributed to landlords slicing up larger units into smaller ones). Other studies have repeatedly confirmed that rent control doesn\\'t affect the overall supply of housing, though landlords may take advantage of poorly written rent control laws that allow them to convert existing rentals into condos to better capture price increases and skirt the intentions of rent control laws—loopholes that could easily be shut […] \\xa0 There are further benefits that the conventional wisdom misses. One, rent control works; as study after study has shown, rent regulation keeps housing more affordable. In Massachusetts, researchers have found that tenants in controlled units pay just half as much in rent as those in non-controlled units of similar size and quality. On the opposite coast, L.A. renters in regulated units pay one-quarter to one-third less in rent than those in nonregulated units—meaning hundreds of dollars a month in savings for households often living paycheck to paycheck. \\xa0 \\xa0 You\\'ve also probably heard that Medicare recently \"negotiated\" the price of expensive prescription drugs. This is effectively an example of the government using its outsized influence as a buyer of these drugs to control prices. Separately, as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration also imposed more direct \"inflation penalties\"—price controls, in other words—on 64 drugs whose prices increased faster than the rate of inflation. And it introduced a $35/month cap on insulin for Medicare patients, which has been so popular that Donald Trump is trying to take credit for it. So when it comes to capping the price of groceries, we shouldn\\'t be so quick to dismiss price controls out of hand. But that doesn\\'t mean they are the only solution to inflation either.\\xa0   Breaking up food monopolies is another way a prospective Harris administration could attempt to fight price gouging. In the U.S., just four grocery chains control 70 percent of the market and most food items are produced by just a handful of manufacturers, making it easy for them to artificially keep prices high without illegally colluding. Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich points to meat prices as a prime example: At the end of 2023, Americans were paying at least 30% more for beef, pork, and poultry products than they were in 2020. \\xa0 Why? Near-monopoly power! Just four companies now control processing of 80 percent of beef, nearly 70 percent of pork, and almost 60 percent of poultry. So of course, it\\'s easy for them to coordinate price increases. \\xa0 And this goes well beyond the grocery store. In 75 percent of U.S. industries, fewer companies now control more of their markets than they did twenty years ago. The Biden administration has already given Harris a head start on reducing the power of monopolies.It has attempted to block the merger of Kroger and Albertsons, has sued the company Agri Stats for giving meat processors an easy means of colluding, and has provided subsidies to regional chicken producers in an attempt to fight \"Big Meat\" and increase competition within the poultry industry.  But we should also look for solutions that are not limited by the constraints of the market. Bruenig, for instance, suggests that rather than simply capping Kroger\\'s prices, \"[a] better idea would be for the federal government to spend about $45 billion to purchase Kroger. This would allow it to directly set the prices for the second-largest grocery store chain in the country.\"\\xa0 Additionally, a lot of the problems inherent to price controls seem to come from attempting to impose them while leaving every other facet of the market intact. Yes, if you limit prices, that may incentivize businesses to produce less. But the government also has tools that it has used in the past to remedy that problem in critical situations.\\xa0 Most notably, there\\'s the Defense Production Act, which was used during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that enough ventilators and N-95 respirators were available to the public. Joe Biden showed how it could be used to address shortages. In 2022, he invoked the DPA to order companies to speed up production amid a national baby formula shortage caused by contamination and supply chain bottlenecks. This power could theoretically be extended to correct any shortage, with the government simply declaring low supply or high costs an emergency.    Regardless of what tools are used, I think it\\'s important that legislators feel at ease to think outside the typical \"Econ 101\" paradigm. Many of the arguments I\\'ve seen criticizing policies against price gouging seem to treat the vagaries of the free market as iron laws that cannot be questioned. Two years ago, the economist and YouTuber Cahal Moran wrote for this magazine that \"doctrinaire and one-eyed statements about how an imagined \\'basic economics\\' implies we can\\'t have nice things are the height of ideology. Most policies have both positive and negative effects, and the degree to which one outweighs the other will depend on careful case-by-case consideration.\" I think that sentiment applies here, too.\\xa0 Remember, the \"basic economics\" framework assumes that there is no such thing as price gouging at all. It not only assumes that prices are just natural outcomes of supply and demand, but that it\\'s a good thing companies have incentives to increase their prices as much as possible. (If you don\\'t believe me, the libertarian think tank Learn Liberty published a video last week arguing that \"Price Gouging is a Good Thing, Actually.\"\\xa0 I considered responding to this video myself, but my colleague Nathan J. Robinson responded to a similar version of this dreadful argument back in 2016 and I\\'d probably be repeating much of what he\\'s already said.) But I think the last few years, in which more families have come to struggle to meet their basic needs as a result of price gouging, have shown pretty unequivocally that it is deeply harmful.\\xa0 We need to be willing to look outside the narrow parameters of what economic orthodoxy allows us to do. We should not ignore history either—we need to be aware of how past efforts to regulate the economy have failed and what can be improved upon. But in a fight to improve people\\'s lives, we should not take any tools off the table.

    "p_text = 'We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Wants You to Check These 10 Stocks.\\xa0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) stands against the Jim Cramer-approved stocks. Jim Cramer noticed a strange pattern during the recent winning streak last week. According to Cramer, when a company reported earnings that were better than expected, its stock price would rise significantly. Even if the results were just a bit better than feared, the stock still went up. Conversely, if a company posted disappointing earnings, the market largely ignored it, believing it was just a temporary setback because the Fed might soon cut interest rates. This led to continued buying. However, this trend changed today as reality began to take hold. \"You see, we had a very odd pattern during the winning streak. It was a bit of Pangloss and a nip of Camelot. When a company reported a better-than-expected quarter, it was great. When a company reported a quarter that was just better than feared, the stock still rose. And when a company reported a bad quarter, we decided that it was the last bad quarter because the Fed was about to cut rates, so it was no big deal—buy anyway. In other words, companies could do no wrong, but not today. Today, we had a bit of a reckoning, a dose of reality.\" Jim Cramer pointed out that Tuesday\\'s market drop was anticipated because the S&P had been rising for eight straight days, and a ninth day would have been unusual, something not seen since 2004. The day was challenging, with the Dow falling 62 points and the S&P dropping 2%, which felt like a bigger loss. This raises concerns about whether the market can continue to rise, especially since negative news finally led to a decline after a strong eight-day rally. \"We were due for today\\'s modest pullback—the S&P had been up for eight straight days, and nine straight would have put us in rarefied territory. We haven\\'t seen that kind of winning streak since 2004. Today\\'s session was rough, with the Dow off by 62 points and the S&P dipping 2%, like losing 33%. We have to wonder if the market still has the momentum to go higher because today we got bad news, and guess what—stocks actually went down. That didn\\'t happen much during the 8-day gain.\" Jim Cramer observed that the market had been in a phase where strong performance drove stock prices up, and even poor results were overlooked because of the belief that the Fed would intervene. However, after seven days of gains, he suggested that this optimistic trend might be ending. The market has now reached a point where stocks no longer automatically benefit from positive bias. \"People had been reporting a perfect market scenario where good performance led to stock gains, and poor performance was cushioned by expectations that the Fed would step in to save the day. But after seven relentlessly positive days, we have to accept that stocks may no longer get the benefit of the doubt. We\\'ve reached a point where the market is sufficiently elevated, and we\\'re back to business as usual—where the good stocks rise, and the bad ones fall. At these high levels, we can\\'t just dismiss the bears with \"heads I win, tails you lose.\" There\\'s a return to rationality, and rationality is the enemy of a market where everything rallies indiscriminately.\" Cramer also mentioned that many investors are hoping for the Fed to step in during their meeting at Jackson Hole on Friday. If those expectations aren\\'t met, there could be significant selling pressure, particularly on a summer Friday. He noted that Lowe\\'s recently suffered because the market might be entering a phase where multiple rate cuts are necessary, but there\\'s no clear indication that such cuts are on the way. Without them, the company may struggle to turn its business around quickly. \"It doesn\\'t help that many expect the Fed cavalry to show up on Friday when they head to Jackson Hole. If things don\\'t go as expected, there could be a lot of selling, especially since it\\'s a summer Friday.\" Our Methodology In this article, we analyzed a recent episode of Jim Cramer\\'s Mad Money and selected ten stocks he talked about. We also included information on how hedge funds feel about each stock and ranked them based on the number of hedge funds that own them, from the fewest to the most. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A state-of-the-art electric vehicle charging at a station at a suburban mall. Number of Hegde Fund Investors: 37 When a viewer asked Jim Cramer about Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), he explained that the company has solid long-term potential due to its significant backing, which reduces the risk of running out of money in the short term. Cramer noted that, while Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) will face challenges in scaling up its operations, he is not focusing on short-term fluctuations. \"I think Rivian has a strong long-term potential because they have significant backing and therefore are unlikely to run out of money in the short term. However, it will be a rocky road as they have many challenges to overcome to ramp up their operations. I\\'m not going to focus on short-term movements, but for someone like you, Henry, who has a long-term horizon, this might be a good investment opportunity.\" Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is poised for significant growth, driven by its successful expansion of production facilities. Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) has increased its production capacity at its Normal, Illinois plant and is building a new facility in Georgia, which will add the ability to produce 250,000 vehicles annually by 2025. Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)\\'s strong order backlog, including a notable 100,000 electric delivery vans from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), highlights substantial revenue potential and client confidence. Consumer demand is also robust, with over 90,000 pre-orders for the R1T and R1S models showing a positive market response. Strategic investments from Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW), along with partnerships such as with Meridian Audio for premium sound systems, bring valuable capital and industry expertise. Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)\\'s ongoing research and development, including its advanced quad-motor system and the introduction of more affordable EV models, strengthens its competitive edge. Additionally, Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)\\'s commitment to sustainability through carbon-neutral manufacturing and the use of sustainable materials meets growing consumer and regulatory expectations. Meridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter: \"Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a US-based manufacturer of electric vehicles, namely the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV. They also have exposure to the commercial vehicle market with their electric delivery vans (EDVs) that are sold to companies like Amazon. The company has faced challenges amid the broader slowdown in electric vehicle demand and rising interest rates. This has contributed to Rivian underperforming expectations over the past few quarters. Rivian has also incurred losses as it continues to invest in the development of its products and manufacturing capabilities. We own Rivian in a hedged structure, which provides a significant margin of safety. Despite the near[1]term challenges, several factors provide optimism that Rivian can emerge as a long-term winner in the EV market. Rivian\\'s balance sheet is strong, with a substantial cash position that enables the company to continue investing in its growth and navigate through the current economic headwinds. Rivian is also unveiling the R2, which is a smaller and more affordable EV platform that will open the company\\'s products to a wider customer base. Lastly, Rivian\\'s investment in the enhancement of its production capabilities should improve the company\\'s manufacturing efficiency and drive a path to profitability. We continue to hold the company in a hedged structure.\" Overall RIVN ranks 9th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer wants you to check out. While we acknowledge the potential of RIVN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RIVN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. \\xa0 READ NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \\'Has Become A Wasteland\\'. \\xa0 Disclosure: None.

The Disrupter: Uruguay Looks Trans-Tasman to Shake Up Mass Timber Russia\\'s supply chain is bleeding, with Western sanctions to blame for one of Russia\\'s largest forestry and paper companies urgently raising funds through the Moscow Stock Exchange— causing its share price to plunge more than 20% in a single day\\'s trade. Yesterday, Segezha Group, Russia\\'s largest pulp and paper producer, reported a 24% loss for the first half of 2024. It comes amid mounting losses, now at RUB 9.5 billion (or US $103 million), and total debt ballooning to RUB 144.2 billion (US $1.56 billion) by June 2024. \"Segezha\\'s financial difficulties are largely driven by ongoing sanctions,\" according to Russian news wire services: \"The company has struggled since losing access to its key European market due to the European Union\\'s embargo on Russian products, including plywood, lumber, and pellets, which took effect in July 2022.\" Wood Central has reported extensively on Russia\\'s acute crisis – with high logistics costs, slowing Chinese demand, and increased competition from India, Brazil, and Argentina, forcing mills to cut production volumes. \"To counter this downturn, some mills have attempted to boost domestic sales by lowering pulp prices and shifting to manufacturing pulp in corrugated cardboard production instead of recycled paper,\" Wood Central revealed in July 2023, with Segezha redirecting huge volumes of kraft paper to the domestic market to cater to local needs. Segezha\\'s current financial troubles come just three years after the (then) world\\'s second-biggest producer of multiwall sack paper and industrial paper sacks pledged to list on the European Stock Exchange in either 2022 or 2023 before Russia invaded Ukrainian territory. The Moscow-listed Segezha, which has forestry assets in Russia and (had) paper packaging plants in Europe and Turkey, was targeting core annual earnings of 100 billion roubles ($1.4 billion) by 2025, up from 17.5 billion roubles last year, according to Rovshan Aliyev, the company\\'s then vice-president for finance and investment. \"As we grow, we will consider a dual listing of our shares … We may return to this question by the end of 2022 or early 2023,\" Mr Aliyev told Reuters in September 2021, just months before the war. \"Most likely, this would be Europe, not the United States, given European companies account for the bulk of the pulp and paper industry.\" \\n                                                         Jason Ross, publisher, is a 15-year professional in building and construction, connecting with more than 400 specifiers.

    "p_text = 'At the store, Monique Gonzalez\\'s daughters chose matching pairs of Converse high-tops. They were beaming, eager to show their new sneakers to their friends at school. It had been a long time since Gonzalez, 41, had been able to afford new shoes for her children. The mother-of-six had been struggling to get by — bills were increasingly difficult to cover with her limited household income, which was a few thousand dollars a month between her and her fiancé. Seeing her daughters excitedly bring their Converse boxes up to the cash register was \"life-changing,\" she said. Gonzalez could afford that purchase because she was a participant in San Antonio\\'s guaranteed basic income program. The pilot gave 1,000 low-income participants an initial $1,908 payment in December 2020, followed by eight quarterly payments of $400 between April 2021 and January 2023. Gonzalez was one of 25 participants chosen to receive an additional $500 a month for 18 months through December 2024. For Gonzalez\\'s family, the pilot income meant being able to move from a motel to a rental home and more comfortably put food on the table. And, once her necessities were covered, she had a small amount of money left to buy her children something special: crayons and markers, Christmas gifts, and the new shoes. She said it made her feel \"worth something.\" \"It absolutely makes you feel 100% better about yourself — seeing that you can provide for your kids\\' needs,\" Gonzalez previously told Business Insider. \"But when you can provide for a want every once in a while, it just puts it over the top.\" Like San Antonio\\'s program, the overall GBI model offers participants recurring cash payments for a set period of time as an approach to poverty reduction. Participants typically receive between $50 and $2,000 a month, no strings attached, for one to five years. Over 100 pilots have been launched in cities across America, with many specifically focused on families. Gonzalez\\'s experience echoes that of many other basic income participants: Cash payments not only provide a monthly financial boost but allow some parents to afford toys and activities for their children — small purchases, they say, that have big impacts on their family\\'s quality of life. \\n                                Related stories\\n                               In contrast to traditional US safety nets like SNAP, housing vouchers, and Medicaid, guaranteed basic income programs place no requirement on how participants spend their money. \"You\\'re deciding what\\'s best for your family, you\\'re the expert on your family,\" Gonzalez said. \"Being able to utilize these funds in a manner that puts you back into control: it boosts your confidence.\" The participants BI spoke with predominantly use their payments for essentials. An analysis of 30 pilot programs involving nearly 8,300 participants found more than half of their payments went toward groceries, transportation, housing, utilities, healthcare, and education. The analysis reflects participant transactions made with a bank account or a debit card, which amounted to about 60% of their total spending. The analysis didn\\'t track how the participants spent cash. While some GBI pilots study changes in participants\\' happiness and mental health, those findings don\\'t specifically include how the extra things people purchased for themselves or their loved ones made them feel. To analyze quality of life impact, experts often look at individual anecdotes and qualitative findings, instead of just quantitative spending data on bills. For some of the parents BI spoke with, guaranteed basic income meant affording stable day care and a stroller to go on neighborhood walks. Others told BI they used the cash to buy a new crib and onesies for their newborn. Melvin Carter, member of the advocacy network Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, said it can be difficult to fully capture the quality of life improvements in a dataset because the benefits differ widely between participants. Still, he said it\\'s clear that cash aid has advantages. \"When parents have money to work with, children are better off,\" Carter, who is also the mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota, previously told BI. Jeanette Fisher received $500 a month between summer 2022 and summer 2023 through Chicago\\'s GBI program. She mainly used the money to pay bills and sign a lease on a new apartment for herself and her daughter. But the 46-year-old single mom said she used some of her first payment to take her daughter, Sophia, to dinner and entertainment at Chuck E. Cheese. They hadn\\'t been since one of Sophia\\'s childhood birthday parties — it meant a lot to Fisher that they could celebrate together. It\\'s a memory they both treasure. \"She\\'s been through a lot,\" Fisher previously told BI. \"And she\\'s an amazing kid.\" Single moms in Birmingham, Alabama\\'s Embrace Mothers basic income pilot had a similar experience. Aside from using their $375 a month to pay bills and afford childcare, many of the 110 mothers spent a portion of their money on toys, dance classes, or holiday gifts for their children. Monica, a Birmingham participant who used only her first name for privacy, spoke to researchers for the program\\'s final report, which was published August 12. She said it\\'s \"amazing\" when she sees her two-year-old daughter happy. \"At the point when I started receiving the money, I started doing the thing where I give her surprises,\" Monica told researchers. \"So come the 15th, I\\'d take her to the Dollar Tree. And I teach her numbers, so I\\'d say: \\'Okay, mommy is going to allow you to have five items today. Let\\'s see if you can count five.\"\\' To be sure, guaranteed basic income may not be a foolproof approach to poverty reduction. GBI programs are temporary, and it is not yet clear how cash payments impact participants in the months and years after the programs end. Some economists and politicians have said that GBI is too expensive for cities and philanthropists to finance over time. Not every family is going to spend guaranteed basic income in the same way, Carter said. But — whether parents are spending cash on meals, new shoes, or something else — he trusts that they are making the best decision for their family\\'s happiness. \"What we\\'re doing is betting on families, betting on families that are used to being bet against,\" Carter previously told BI. \"We\\'re betting on families\\' ability to know how to manage their money.\" Have you benefited from a guaranteed basic income program?

    "p_text = 'eNewspaper Sign up for email newsletters  Sign up for email newsletters eNewspaper \\n\\t\\t\\tTrending:\\t\\t Donald Trump has proposed across-the-board tariffs on goods made abroad and sold in America, as well as substantial corporate tax cuts. Kamala Harris has proposed tax increases on corporations and the wealthy and a tougher federal response to what she deems \"price gouging\" by businesses. What neither candidate has done so far when it comes to the nation\\'s economy is to address the actual challenges facing the federal government. Presidential campaigns tend to be overly broad on economic policy, all the better to give the winner maximum flexibility to act on taxing and spending once they take office. But in the past candidates generally have spoken to the actual issues at hand. At this point in the 2024 election, voters aren\\'t even getting that much. The elephant in the room is that a substantial portion of the last major rewrite of the tax code, which Trump signed into law in 2017, will expire at the end of 2025. Most of the expiring provisions pertain to tax reductions for individuals. In order to enact as low of a corporate tax rate as possible (the GOP settled on 21%) while keeping within deficit financing limits, Trump and fellow Republicans in 2017 bet that Congress in 2025 would find it politically unpalatable to allow federal taxes on individuals to increase and would extend those cuts. That remains a good bet, but here\\'s the difference between then and now. The federal budget deficit when the Trump tax cuts were enacted was $665 billion. This fiscal year it\\'s approaching $2 trillion. The deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product in 2017 was 3.5%; this year it\\'s set to be 7%. If the country were in a deep recession or still reeling from the effects of the COVID pandemic, such profligacy might be justifiable. It is plainly irresponsible now, and neither candidate even mentions the deficit, much less suggests how to reduce it. Both campaigns are doing the voters a major disservice in failing to realistically address the issue of the nation\\'s fiscal woes and how they would handle the tax battle royale to come. The political adage, \"It\\'s the economy, stupid,\" happens to be true. Polls show Americans are most concerned about the state of their pocketbooks; much of that angst has been trained on the aftereffects of the post-COVID inflationary period that substantially raised the prices of necessities like food, insurance and utilities. Both candidates have pledged to bring prices down. Trump has made those promises without saying how he\\'d do it. His promise to impose an across-the-board 10% tariff on imported goods is one of the more concrete of his economic policies, and most economists believe such protectionism would be highly inflationary. Trump\\'s response is that the jobs created by giving American companies such a big boost would create economic growth that would more than make up for the costs. Our philosophical default there to back the free market. Harris has offered a new clampdown on corporate \"price gouging,\" which has garnered brickbats even from some left-leaning pundits well aware of the history of price controls and the negative macroeconomic fallout they create. The truth is that consumers have done more to tame inflation than any government official ever could by changing buying habits. Companies selling name-brand everyday products now bemoan their lagging sales and are pivoting to appeal to cost-conscious consumers. So what should the federal government do to promote economic growth and stability? As is the case for households, it needs to get its fiscal house in order and set spending priorities. It\\'s worth retracing how we got to a point where nearly a third — yes, you read that right — of what the feds will spend this year is being put on the national credit card. The aforementioned Trump tax law was deficit-financed from the start. This page at the time thought that was a good risk to take in order to jolt what had been a slow-growth economy into something more dynamic. Republicans said sustainable 3% annual growth in gross domestic product was the goal. The economy never got there before the pandemic upended our economic life, and we\\'re not at that level today. One result that is undeniable, though, is that corporations have invested a large chunk of the tax windfall they\\'re enjoying into repurchasing their own stock; for many, financial engineering appears a better use of excess cash than investing in growth initiatives that lead to higher employment. Stock buybacks are on course to set a record this year and to top $1 trillion in 2025, according to Goldman Sachs. The Democrats have had a strong hand in inflating the deficit as well. Massive federal spending, first to soften the blow of COVID on businesses and households and then to finance the Biden administration\\'s debt-financed investments in infrastructure and green energy, significantly exacerbated the problem. No matter who wins the White House and which party controls Congress, there will be a sprawling tax bill next year, due to the overwhelming bipartisan desire to ensure there isn\\'t a tax hike on the majority of Americans through mere inaction. Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who represents a broad swath of the Chicago suburbs, told us in an interview during the Democratic National Convention that he believes even the liberal wing of his party understands those $2 trillion deficits can\\'t continue, even if few wanted to talk about that at the United Center. When the time comes, the job of coming to terms on a package that apportions the tax burden fairly while simultaneously reducing the deficit will be made significantly easier if the winning campaign comes to the table with something resembling a thumbs-up from voters on how to accomplish that. There\\'s no way Trump or Harris will be able to do so if they don\\'t even acknowledge the issue will be one of the first items on the next president\\'s agenda and offer a broad-strokes idea of how to respond. Likewise, the lack of any mention of the deficit by either candidate is, while perhaps politically strategic, a disservice to the country. We daresay only a sliver of the taxpaying public understands they\\'re financing close to a third of the federal budget with debt. The U.S. enjoys a special status as having the world\\'s leading currency and being the pre-eminent safe haven for global investors. But red ink like we\\'re seeing now isn\\'t sustainable.

Shares of the retailer, which caters to more rural areas, tumbled 25% after the earnings report. The company now expects fiscal 2024 same-store sales to be up 1.0% to 1.6%, lower than its prior outlook for a 2% to 2.7% increase. Earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of just $5.50 to $6.20, versus the prior forecast of $6.80 to $7.55 per share. \"While we believe the softer sales trends are partially attributable to a core customer who feels financially constrained, we know the importance of controlling what we can control,\" said CEO Todd Vasos in a statement. However, he also acknowledged that the company has more work to do. Dollar General has said that it needs to improve its stores and how it handles inventory to curb losses. Here\\'s how Dollar General did in its second fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: The company\\'s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 2 was $374 million, or $1.70 per share, compared with $469 million, or $2.13 per share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $10.21 billion, up about 4.2% from $9.80 billion a year earlier. Competitor Dollar Tree was falling in sympathy, off by more than 7% in early trading. Got a confidential news tip?

    "p_text = 'Donna Gittens felt drained as she struggled to form words. Dinner plans with her husband and friends would have to wait. She worried she was in the middle of a stroke. Gittens was rushed to Carney Hospital, minutes from her home in Boston\\'s Dorchester neighborhood. Last summer\\'s emergency spanned two facilities as physicians unraveled a medical mystery. The underlying issue was a brain infection, but she credits her neighborhood hospital\\'s doctors and nurses with saving her life. She now worries others in her area won\\'t have access to the same emergency care. Carney is one of two Massachusetts hospitals targeted for closure Aug. 31 following recent chaotic developments at Steward Health Care. The embattled for-profit hospital chain filed for bankruptcy on May 6 and has been mired in crises involving patients and creditors across several states. The chain is led by a former heart surgeon who collected more than $100 million in compensation and bought a $40 million yacht while employees at Steward hospitals complained about a lack of basic supplies, according to a Senate committee. More than 2,200 employees now expect to be laid off in Massachusetts and Ohio, according to notices filed with state regulators. The company\\'s CEO, who lawmakers say has declined multiple requests to answer questions voluntarily, is expected to appear under subpoena in mid-September before a Senate committee to address \"financial mismanagement\" at Steward. The case has raised broader issues for lawmakers and analysts about the role of private equity investments in health care. Many people from communities impacted by hospital closures are asking why there aren\\'t built-in protections when a corporation takes over an institution providing essential life-or-death services. The problem extends beyond Massachusetts. State health regulators in Arizona this month suspended operations at a Steward-owned psychiatric hospital after the air conditioning at the Phoenix facility cut off amid triple-digit temperatures. In West Monroe, Louisiana, hospital workers described searching the premises for basic medical supplies during procedures. One patient died at the hospital awaiting transfer to another hospital, resulting in an \"immediate jeopardy\" citation from regulators, according to testimony at a Louisiana House Health and Welfare Committee meeting in April. After the chain declared bankruptcy, the Massachusetts governor enacted an emergency plan to manage the disposition of its seven remaining hospitals there. The company sought and received approval from the bankruptcy court to shutter Carney and a second facility, Nashoba Valley Medical Center in Ayer, by the end of August. Gittens, who survived a health scare, worries her local neighborhood with a diverse, mixed-income population, will be left without essential medical care. During medical emergencies like hers last summer, timely care can be the difference between life and death. \"Carney is integral not only to my family – but the broader community,\" said Gittens. Despite pleas from neighborhood leaders, the state has no plans to keep Carney or Nashoba Valley open. However, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said at an Aug. 16 news conference the state plans to use eminent domain to take control of another Steward hospital, St. Elizabeth\\'s Medical Center in Brighton. The state has struck deals with other operators to run the other four Steward hospitals. Healey blamed Steward\\'s financial collapse on its CEO, Dr. Ralph de la Torre, and the hospital chain\\'s executives. \"This is not something that Massachusetts created,\" Healey said. \"It was created by the greed and the exploitation of an individual, Ralph de la Torre, and members of his team. De la Torre\\'s actions brought us to nearly the brink of collapse\" at Steward\\'s hospitals. A spokesperson representing de la Torre did not respond to questions from USA TODAY about allegations of problems at an array of Steward Health Care facilities. In a statement, the company said it would seek to minimize disruptions to patients. \"This is a challenging and very unfortunate situation, and the effect it will have on our patients, our employees, and the communities we serve is regrettable,\" the statement provided by Steward representative Deborah Chiaravalloti said. \"SHC (Steward Health Care) is doing all we can to ensure a smooth transition for those affected, while continuing to provide quality care to the patients we serve.\" Steward Health Care was formed in 2010 when Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity firm, acquired a financially struggling nonprofit hospital chain from the Archdiocese of Boston. De la Torre, a Harvard Medical faculty member who previously led cardiac surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, became CEO of the new entity, named Steward Health Care. The Dallas-based company aggressively expanded to a chain of more than 30 hospitals employing more than 30,000 people. The expansion was fueled by a splashy deal engineered by de la Torre to sell the land underneath Steward\\'s hospitals to a corporate landlord, Medical Properties Trust. The sale-leaseback deal left the hospitals with hefty rent payments. Bankruptcy filings show the company is now reeling with $9 billion in debt, including more than $6 billion in lease payments to its landlord. After the bankruptcy filing in May, Steward announced plans to close hospitals and lay off thousands of workers, leaving community members who depend on the hospitals worried about where they will get care. The chain\\'s financial flameout captured the attention of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which authorized an investigation into the company\\'s financial dealings. The Senate probe is expected to include questions about Steward Health\\'s deal with private equity investors, its lavish spending, the lease deal and the hospital closures. The committee also issued a subpoena that compels de la Torre to answer questions about his company\\'s struggles. At a July 25 hearing, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, who chairs the committee overseeing the investigation, said de la Torre refused multiple invitations to testify before lawmakers, which prompted the bipartisan vote to order him to testify on Sept. 12. While Steward closed its hospitals, Sanders said, de la Torre was collecting a \"$100 million payday that he used to purchase a $40 million yacht.\" Sanders said the executive also bought a $15 million, custom-made fishing boat and had access to two private jets. De la Torre \"epitomizes the type of outrageous corporate greed that is permeating throughout our for-profit health care system,\" Sanders said at the hearing. \"Today we are saying enough is enough. It is time for Dr. de la Torre to get off of his yacht and to explain to Congress the financial chicanery which made him extremely wealthy, while the hospitals he managed went bankrupt.\" When asked which sources Sanders relied on for his July testimony about de la Torre\\'s compensation and boats, his staff provided links to articles in The American Prospect, The Boston Globe and Becker\\'s Hospital Review. Beyond Capitol Hill, Steward is being scrutinized by other entities. The Justice Department launched a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud and corruption at the company, CBS and other outlets reported. The Justice Department and the U.S. Attorney in Boston declined to comment on whether the health care chain was under investigation. Steward also has been investigated in the Mediterranean nation of Malta, where the company reached a $4 billion euro deal to manage three hospitals. In May, a Maltese magistrate recommended criminal charges against de la Torre. That probe involved the former prime minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, who was charged with money laundering, corruption and bribery. He has pleaded not guilty and faces up to 18 years in prison, according to local media. Your wallet, explained. Sign up for USA TODAY\\'s Daily Money newsletter. The bankruptcy, hospital closings and disruptions to patient care at Steward are not the only issues the Senate committee will probe. Sanders plans to seek answers into private equity\\'s growing stake in the health care sector. Sanders said at a July hearing private equity firms own 460 hospitals in the United States – or about 1 in 5 for-profit hospitals. \"How many of these hospitals are being loaded up with debt in order to make a handful of executives and private equity firms even wealthier?\" Sanders pondered aloud. \"How many of these hospitals are in danger of being shut down? How many patients are at risk?\" Experts say the Steward bankruptcy raises concerns about private equity\\'s involvement in the health care industry. Under the Steward model, the company\\'s debt became overwhelming as it acquired more hospitals and doctors\\' practices. The financial problems following Steward\\'s acquisition spree were inevitable, said Dr. Vikas Saini, president of the Lown Institute, a Massachusetts-based health think tank. Saini blames the chaos on the lack of regulatory oversight for health care mergers and acquisitions. \"It illustrates how moth-eaten our oversight and regulatory apparatus is for the health care sector,\" Saini said. He added that hospital takeovers have \"much more social impact, much more meaning to communities than whether or not an iPhone plant gets built.\" Hospital ownership changes require more guardrails, transparency and public scrutiny, Saini said. \"We\\'ve got to be sure that you\\'re not just selling us a bill of goods.\" In Louisiana, state health regulators scrutinized Steward-owned Glenwood Regional Medical Center, which was hit with three \"immediate jeopardy\" warnings in 120 days from December 2023 through early 2024. These citations described lapses that put patients\\' safety in jeopardy and could result in the termination of Medicare and Medicaid payments. Debra Russell, a Glenwood nurse practitioner, worked at the hospital for more than three decades before she quit last November. During an April hearing before a Louisiana legislative committee, she described the dire circumstances for patients at the hospital. She recalled having to switch tactics in the middle of a procedure because the hospital didn\\'t have a $5 tube called a guide wire. In another case, a young man came to the emergency room after a heart attack but staffers could not reach an on-call cardiologist because the specialist hadn\\'t been paid. When staff tried to order medication from the pharmacy for the patient, the drug wasn\\'t stocked because the hospital\\'s supplier hadn\\'t been paid. Evidence of the financial crunch also was visible outside the emergency room. Russell described coffee pots being repossessed and said document shredding companies had quit. Steward\\'s days of operating that hospital appear to be nearing an end. Steward has announced another hospital operator, American Healthcare Systems, has bid to purchase Glenwood. The bankruptcy court must approve the deal. Steward declined to answer questions about the sale or operations at Glenwood. In a news release issued last May, the hospital said it addressed issues raised by state and federal regulators following the immediate jeopardy warnings. During the Senate hearing this spring, Russell, the former Louisiana staffer, recalled her final days at the Steward-owned hospital as particularly gutting to witness. \"It\\'s the saddest thing I\\'ve ever been around,\" Russell said. Dr. Charles Fischman thought he had sufficiently vetted Steward Health Care after executives approached him about purchasing his Vero Beach, Florida, medical practice in early 2017. The internal medicine doctor was nearing retirement age and considering his next steps. He wanted to make sure his 10,000 patients, two fellow doctors, a nurse practitioner and administrative staff were in good hands. When Fischman met with Steward executives, he said each leader was more charming than the next. He felt comfortable with the idea of a physician-led company acquiring his practice. Steward representatives talked to his employees over breakfast and eased their worries. \"We felt good about it,\" Fischman said. But weeks after Steward took over on June 1, 2018, problems surfaced, he said. Longtime vendors, such as lab suppliers, complained they had not been paid. The local water and power companies were within 24 hours of shutting off services due to unpaid bills. Under the terms of the acquisition, Fischman signed a two-year contract to remain as a physician and a lab director. Things didn\\'t improve in the following weeks and months, Fischman said. Fischman\\'s wife, Carol, who also worked at the office, fielded complaints from vendors – people the Fischmans knew personally after 30 years in the community. They wanted to get reimbursed for their services so they could pay their mortgages and cover other basic living expenses, he said. At a Vero Beach dinner meeting with some Steward executives months after the hospital chain bought the medical practice, Carol asked why the vendors\\' payments were delinquent. She didn\\'t get answers. \"All we heard were stories about fishing boats and hospitals in Malta,\" he said, recalling his conversations with Steward executives. His wife eventually quit in frustration. Fischman said executives pressured him to refer patients only to other Steward-employed physicians. He eventually left the practice in April 2020 and relocated to Tampa, where he still sees patients a few days a week. Chiaravalloti, of Steward, did not answer questions about the Vero Beach medical offices. State health officials and medical community leaders from Massachusetts to Louisiana are now trying to assess how Steward Health Care\\'s bankruptcy will affect day-to-day operations, as new information about the company\\'s business dealings and practices continues to emerge. On Aug. 19, the Massachusetts governor\\'s office sent a letter to Steward describing Carney Hospital as an \"essential service\" for Dorchester residents, while acknowledging the state lacks the \"power to mandate\" the hospital remain open. Some community leaders are urging the governor to keep the hospital open nonetheless. Bill Walczak, a former president of Carney, said the Dorchester hospital has been plagued by \"terrible decisions\" going back decades, long before Steward took ownership. But he said Carney is worth saving to ensure access for up to 250,000 people who live in its service territory. He described it as a health equity issue for residents. Offering such a remedy is within the state\\'s purview, he said. \"Massachusetts is a very wealthy state, and it has a lot of power,\" Walczak said. \"If the legislature and governor and secretary of Health and Human Services wanted to put together a package today to preserve the essential services of the Carney Hospital, they could do it.\" Walczak noted the Healey administration vowed to use eminent domain to seize Steward\\'s St. Elizabeth\\'s Hospital in Brighton and transfer the facility to Boston Medical Center. The governor said Boston Medical Center\\'s willingness to take over St. Elizabeth\\'s was necessary to get the deal done. The hospital\\'s landlord, however, vowed to fight the seizure. The company that owns the property rejected Gov. Healey\\'s opening bid of $4.5 million to buy the location. Representatives of Healey and the state\\'s Department of Public Health did not immediately answer questions about next steps in the hospital seizure. Dorchester leaders want the governor to orchestrate a similar deal to keep Carney open. \"This is not over,\" Walczak said. \"Perhaps the governor will understand there are a lot of lives that would be put in jeopardy by not having an emergency room and beds, at a minimum, in this section of the city.\" Ken Alltucker is on X at\\xa0@kalltucker, contact him by email at alltuck@usatoday.com.'\n",
